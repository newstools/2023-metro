A 15-year-old girl who died after being stabbed in Hexham has been named locally. Holly Newton, also known as Holly Olivia, was described as a ‘beautiful girl’ who loved to dance by her friends. People gathered in the Northumberland town centre to lay messages, flowers and teddy bears over the weekend in tribute to the teenager. One message left by a loved one read: ‘All our love to the most beautiful girl in the world. We will miss you forever Holly.’ Another read: ‘To our baby Holly. Our hearts hurt so much right now. We love you so much.’ A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Holly’s family with funeral costs, and has raised more than £3,500 so far. Holly was stabbed hours after leaving school on Friday, with police called shortly after 5.10pm to reports of an injured boy and girl. They were both taken to hospital where Holly died later that evening. The 16-year-old boy remains in a stable condition. Another 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Chief Superintendent Sam Rennison said police believe all those involved were known to each other, and are treating the murder as an isolated incident. At a press conference on Saturday, she said: ‘First and foremost, our hearts go out to her loved ones at this truly devastating time. ‘A 16-year-old boy who was also injured during the incident remains in hospital in a stable condition. ‘He and his family are also very much in our thoughts. An investigation was immediately launched and while this is at the very early stages, we do believe all those involved are known to each other. ‘We would like to thank the public for their continued support and co-operation. ‘In particular, those who tried to provide assistance yesterday to the injured boy and girl at the scene.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
