Planning your next trip? If you want to follow your stomach to greener pastures, then TripAdvisor’s Traveller’s Choice list of Best Food Destinations in the world might be worth a look in. By ranking locations based on the quantity and quality of traveller reviews submitted during the last year, the company has compiled a new list of the top foodie destinations for 2023. According to reviewers, Europe is a hotbed of culinary excellence, with seven of the top 10 locations – including the one ranked the very best – under its belt. Sadly none of the top spots have been taken by the UK, so you’ll have to go further afield if you want to hit a destination on the list. Meanwhile, Italy is out there making us look bad, with not one, not two, but three of the top 10 spots being in that Mediterranean nation. The location named the very best food destination of the year is in Italy too, making the country an absolute must-visit for foodies everywhere. And what location was that, we hear you ask? None other than Rome, the historic capital. The other Italian cities on the list are Florence, which came in fourth on the list, and Naples, in eighth place. The only non-European locations that made the top ten are Hanoi, Vietnam, New Orleans, USA and Jamaica. Do you have a story to share?
