An ‘outgoing’ young carer took her own life on Boxing Day after struggling for months with undiagnosed severe chronic pain. Chloe Hudson, 22, from Weymouth in Dorset died in Dorchester’s County Hospital just hours after saying her final goodbyes to her loved ones. Friends have raised more than £11,000 to pay for her funeral and support her family as they remembered the ‘beautiful and lovely’ young woman. ‘She was definitely outgoing, partying, always at festivals, or just on holiday,’ said sister Chelsea. ‘She had loads of friends and she was always a good laugh, wore bright colours and was a wild spirit. ‘At such a young age, she had done a lot more than most 80-year-olds. She was always somewhere.’ Chloe grew up in nearby Portland, attending the Isle of Portland Community School before working as a carer in several Weymouth care homes. A GoFundMe appeal set up by friend Eloise Ambrose has raised more than £11,400 for the family of Chloe who was due to start a new care role in the New Year. Glowing tributes and messages have been shared online to remember Chloe, with many calling her ‘beautiful’ and a ‘lovely soul’. ‘We have been really supported by everyone,’ said her aunt Erin Potts. ‘Everyone has been kind, offered us help and done lovely things for us. ‘It’s been nice to see how many friends Chloe has got. It’s not just her friends donating to the fundraiser but also people across Weymouth. It’s a community that has pulled together.’ Amanda Green, who babysat both Chloe and her sister, said she was ‘shocked beyond belief’ to hear of her passing. ‘Sending love and hugs and thoughts to the family,’ she wrote. ‘RIP Chloe. I can’t believe you’re gone.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
