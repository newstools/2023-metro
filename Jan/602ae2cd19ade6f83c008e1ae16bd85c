A 20-stone-pig made a desperate bid for freedom and was found 40 miles from home. Two-year-old Gertie ran free of its owner’s smallholding in Wales and they have said she ‘thinks she is a dog’ due to her domesticated life. But the giant kune kune porker – who has black and white patchy fur – vanished from its home in Newport, Gwent, on Thursday. Owner Holly Gillum feared Gertie had got loose and launched a desperate to get her home before she was found 40 miles away from home. Holly said: ‘She is like a family member. I have had her since she was a piglet. It has upset the children particularly. ‘She thinks she is a dog. She has free roam of the farm and she is very well known for being loud. When I arrive to feed her she screams the place down.’ Holly posted on Facebook and said: ‘Our family pet pig has been missing since yesterday, we live on the canal and she is extremely friendly.. she may have gone through the forest towards the top of altyryn – highcross – or down canal towards grove kennels. ‘Her name is Gertie and she will approach anyone for a fuss, please if anyone sees her let me know , me and the children and frantic looking for her none of us slept last night.’ Holly said Gertie ‘is extremely friendly’ and believed she may have made off towards a forest in countryside near her home. She said: ‘She will approach anyone for a fuss. Me and the children were frantic looking for her.’ In a video online Holly was reunited with Gertie after they were alerted of her whereabouts thanks to posts on Facebook. Holly said: ‘I sobbed when I saw her I just burst into tears, I didn’t expect to find her alive. ‘If she was alive I expected her to be injured but she’s okay. ‘It’s appalling. Who takes a pig, maybe hides her, and dumps her 40 miles away?’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
