On her visit to Windsor Foodshare, a local food bank, she and Prince William heard about the support being offered to families. For the event, the Princess of Wales dazzled in a beautiful pink Hobbs jumper and overcoat combination, which she paired with a staple pair of black wide-leg flared trousers. She previously wore the fuchsia pink coat and turtleneck jumper on an engagement in 2021. And it seems Kate has a penchant for flares. Over the years, she’s been pictured in an enviable collection of flared trousers, such as during a 2018 trip to Cyprus, when she paired an olive green blazer with some glorious navy flares. More recently, in June last year, Kate wore a gorgeous pair of black, slim flares and a cream jumper on a visit to a baby bank in Brent. She’s also a fan of the lightly more subtle bootleg cut.
