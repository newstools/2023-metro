Pep Guardiola has hinted that the injury John Stones picked up during Manchester City’s FA Cup win over Arsenal was self-inflicted. The Citizens beat the Gunners 1-0 at the Etihad on Friday night, courtesy of a second-half goal from Nathan Ake. It was a big win for City who were able to get the better of their Premier League title rivals in the first of three meetings between the two sides this season. However it came at a cost, with Stones being forced off shortly before half-time with a hamstring injury, with Aymeric Laporte taking his place. While Guardiola say he doesn’t know how serious the centre-back’s injury is, one can expect the 28-year-old to be out for the next few games at least. This means who could miss important league visits to Tottenham and Arsenal, as City look to close the five-point gap to Mikel Arteta’s side. However, Guardiola also appeared to aim a dig at Stones regarding the injury, seemingly claiming that the player was not fit enough to start the game. ‘Today he was not ready, I saw it in the first minutes,’ the manager said. ‘Maybe he was tired, I don’t know, but he was not ready and that’s why when this happens you get injured.’ Thankfully for Guardiola, his City squad remains largely injury free with Stones only joined on the sidelines by England teammate Phil Foden, who remains out with a foot injury. City now advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup with the draw set to take place on Monday night, with games to be played on March 1st.
