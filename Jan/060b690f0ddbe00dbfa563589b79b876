Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu has let out a massive sigh of relief after surviving the first skate-off of Dancing On Ice 2023. The Love Island winner, 29, went up against former pro footballer John Fashanu, 60, in the bottom two. But, after both couples gave it their all, it was Ekin-Su and her partner Brendyn Hatfield who the panel – Oti Mabuse, Ashley Banjo, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean – decided to save. Having survived to skate in Musicals Week, Ekin-Su could not have been happier, telling viewers how thankful she was to have another chance. ‘I feel absolutely honoured, blessed, and… just blessed,’ she said on the Dancing On Ice Instagram page. ‘Thank you so much to all of the judges for believing in me and the process and I won’t let them down.’ ‘I love you all so much and I’m so excited for Musical’s Week, it’s my favourite!’, she exclaimed. ‘Oh, it’s gonna be so much fun!’, pro Brendyn chimed in. ‘And thank you to my partner, he’s amazing. He always calms me,’ Ekin-Su then praised, before the two shared a sweet hug. Posting a picture to her own account – which boasts 3.2million followers – the Turkish actress posed on the ice next to her partner, looking stunning in a flowy purple dress. ‘We made it through! Thank you so much for your support this week, thanks to the judges and thank you @brendynhatfield loved every second of that performance…roll on musicals week ⛸️’, she wrote in her caption. Naturally, the TV icon was inundated with support from her fans and famous friends, with fellow Islander Indiyah Polack commenting: ‘A very welldone Ekin!! Love you 💕💕💕💕’ ‘Well done Ekin 👏👏’, wrote Andrew Le Page. A fan wrote: ‘Well done Ekin Su!!!! Your were fantastic!!!! So glad you made it through!!!!😄👍🏻’ ‘Congratulations Ekin, you need to be more fearless and believe you can’, encouraged another. The star found herself in the bottom two after a racy first skate to Toxic by Britney Spears. Despite an outpouring of love online, the influencer came bottom of the public vote, and even received Ofcom complains for her daring outfit. Having vowed to be more ‘conservative’ with her clothing choices, Ekin-Su’s save-me skate was a fun routine to No Tears Left To Cry by Ariana Grande, while John and his pro Alexandra Schauman performed to Norman Greenbaum’s Spirit In The Sky. After the couples went head to head, the judges voted unanimously to save the reality star, sending John packing. However, the sporting star confirmed he will carry on skating and said he might even start teaching others. Dancing On Ice continues Sunday on ITV. Got a story?
