This is the aftermath of an apartment building collapse, which killed at least six people in southern Egypt yesterday. Rescue teams recovered six bodies from under the rubble of a five-story building in the Qulta neighbourhood of the city of Assiut, some 250 miles south of Cairo. Essam Saad, the province’s governor, confirmed two survivors were pulled out of the wreckage alive and were rushed to a local hospital. A video shared on social media shows rescuers attempting to dig through all the debris at the scene. Bulldozers and other equipment were also dispatched to clear and secure the site. Meanwhile, people were also asked to leave the surrounding buildings because of structural concerns. By Sunday night, rescue teams were still searching for survivors as security forces cordoned off the area around the building. It was not immediately known what caused the building to collapse, but incidents like this one are common in Egypt. Shoddy construction and a lack of maintenance are widespread in shantytowns, poor city neighborhoods and rural areas. The government has tried to crack down on illegal building in recent years after decades of lax enforcement. Mr Saad said officials would investigate the incident, and examine surrounding buildings for residents’ safety. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
