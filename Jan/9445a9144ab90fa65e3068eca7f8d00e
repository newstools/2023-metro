Caught in the bloody battle for Bakhmut, civilians there have lived life in the crossfire for months – forced to take cover as Russia desperately tries to claim a Ukrainian-held city that has become the epicentre of fighting. No place in Bakhmut is ‘not covered with blood,’ declared Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on a recent visit to what has become a bombed-out ghost town. ‘There is no hour when the terrible roar of artillery does not sound. Still, Bakhmut stands,’ he said. Last year, 70,000 people lived in the city, located in the eastern province of Donetsk. But after Ukraine’s fightback in Kharkiv and Kherson late last year, Bakhmut became Russia’s main target – one of the few front lines in Ukraine where Russia remained on the offensive. By early December, after months of hiding out, only around 10,000 civilians were still there. And now, after fresh waves of rocket attacks over Christmas, Zelensky says ‘only a few remain’. However, as soldiers continue their brutal urban warfare in the new European no-man’s land, families are still hiding out in the city. Photographer Andre Luis Alves went in search of those families – from children through to the elderly – surviving in a homeland under fire.
