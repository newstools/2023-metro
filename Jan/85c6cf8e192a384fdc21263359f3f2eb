If the cold UK weather has made you want to relocate to sunnier and warmer climes, we don’t blame you. And it seems it would be a more economical move, too. New research has suggested that it’s actually cheaper for Brits to move and reside in various European locations – rather than continuing to live in the UK. UK-based property experts, Your Overseas Home, compared the cost of everyday necessities, setting up a proper home abroad, and living long-term in seven of the most popular European expat destinations: Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece. They then compared these to current life in the UK. The results, published in the new Overseas Cost of Living Index, found that – when looking at the average cost for the country as a whole (rather than breaking it down by region) – the UK comes out as the most expensive. So where is the most cost-effective place to live? Italy came out as the cheapest place to live long-term – with groceries costing less when it comes to basics such as milk, bread, eggs, fruit, vegetables and toiletries. In fact, one basket filled with 17 basic items comes to around £48.82 – whereas in the UK, it’s 40% more expensive. Italy was also named the cheapest place to live if you compare electricity, decorating supplies, furniture and electrics – as well as the cost of hiring a local cleaner. Findings also revealed that the average cup of coffee costs £3.20 in the UK, but only £1.03 in Portugal and Spain – a difference of 220%. Do you have a story to share?
