More than a dozen Metropolitan Police officers have been convicted of serious offences since the murder of Sarah Everard – with the majority committing sex crimes or violence against women. The killing of Ms Everard, 33, on March 3, 2021, at the hands of serving officer Wayne Couzens, sent shockwaves across the nation and raised serious concerns about women’s safety on the streets. Now fears are growing that more officers within the force could be unmasked as criminals, after serial rapist PC David Carrick last week pleaded guilty to 49 charges, including 24 counts of rape against 12 women, between 2003 and 2020. The Met apologised and conceded it had ‘missed opportunities’ to remove Carrick – branded one of the worst offenders in modern history. Carrick was allowed to get away with his crimes for two decades until he was arrested in October 2021 and has now been kicked out of the force. Here a timeline reveals the officers convicted in the wake of Ms Everard’s tragic death. In October last year, it was revealed how hundreds of officers working for Britain’s biggest force have avoided being sacked after breaking the law. Of 1,809 staff facing misconduct charges since 2013, just 13 had been dismissed, in damning revelations described as ‘appalling’ by Met Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley. In the wake of Carrick’s conviction, women’s charity Refuge dumped more than 1,000 bad apples outside New Scotland Yard’s HQ in central London in a bid to highlight the scale of abuse allegations engulfing the force. The Met is currently reviewing 1,633 previously reported allegations of sexual and domestic abuse involving 1,071 officers and staff. Last week, it was revealed how a Met Police abuse complaints hotline received 700 calls in a single day about alleged sex and domestic violence by officers.
