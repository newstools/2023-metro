Police are still trying to identify a man who was found on a beach three months ago and doesn’t know who he is, or where he is from. The man, thought to be aged between 40 and 50 years old, was found in Weymouth, Dorset in September last year. He speaks with an eastern European accent and his first language is believed to be Latvian, according to Dorset Police. The case somewhat resembles an aspect of the Jason Bourne film series, originally written by British novelist Robert Ludlum, about a highly trained Foreign Service Officer who finds himself washed up on the French coast with amnesia. Police Constable Becky Barnes said: ‘We have been continuing to conduct enquiries to try and establish the identity of this man, which have included contact with Interpol and other partner agencies. ‘However, we have still been unable to confirm an identity for this man and he has not been able to tell us who he is or provide any information about where he is from or his family. ‘He remains in the safe care of the health service and his appearance has changed somewhat since he was first found as he has now cut his hair and beard. ‘I am therefore issuing updated images of the man in case it might assist anyone who has information relating to his identity.’ When he was found he had long, curly matted brown hair, a brown beard and was wearing a black motorcycle helmet with no visor and a black leather jacket. He was also wearing a black shirt, a pair of black suit trousers on top of another pair of black trousers and brown workmen’s boots and he was carrying a black rucksack. He is 5ft 9ins tall and of slim build. Anyone with information about the man’s identity is asked to contact Dorset Police or by calling 101, quoting occurrence number 5522015801 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
