UFC legend Conor McGregor says he could have died after being hit by car while cycling. McGregor, 34, was cycling through the Irish countryside on Friday when a car drove into him from behind. The MMA superstar, who intends to return to the octagon this summer, was sent flying off his bike but appears to have emerged from the scary collision with minimal injuries. In a video uploaded to Instagram, McGregor is seen talking to the driver and reassuring him that he was fine despite the ordeal. ‘Got a bang of a car just now from behind,’ McGregor said. ‘A sun trap, the driver couldn’t see me. ‘Full speed straight through me. Thank you God, it wasn’t my time. Thank you wrestling and judo also. Having an awareness on the landing saved my life.’ McGregor, who was given a lift by the driver, then said: ‘I could have been dead there. Jesus Christ. I got away with my life there, boys. That was lucky. ‘I’m here with Mick… Mick smacked me with his car. We’ve got the bike in the back, it wasn’t our time, Mick, that’s all. God bless, and we’re f*****g still here, thank God. That’s all that matters.’ McGregor won 22 of his 28 UFC fights and suffered back-to-back defeats to Dustin Poirier in 2021 before being forced to have a spell on the sidelines due to injury. The Irishman also had one professional boxing fight in which he lost to the undefeated Floyd Mayweather. The pair have been linked with a rematch but McGregor has seemingly set his sights on huge UFC fights instead.
