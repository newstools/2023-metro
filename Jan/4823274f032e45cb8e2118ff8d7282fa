The Glazer family are adamant that they will not sell Manchester United for less than £6billion and would rather remain in control of the club than to sell for below their asking price. The Americans put United on the market in November, with the family open to anything from investment to a full sale of the club. Roman Abramovich’s sale of Chelsea last year – which was an initial £2.5bn and a further £1.75bn in investment commitments – has persuaded the Glazers to put the club up for sale. There has already been significant interest in the club, given its global appeal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe – Britain’s richest man – has declared his interest, while Qatar Sports Investments are also interested. However, the future of the club could depend on the asking price the Glazers set and the Daily Mail say they will not accept lower than £6bn for a full sale. This would be the biggest ownership deal in sports history and could complicate the club’s future, even if there’s a bidder willing to pay the price. United require at least £1bn to renovate Old Trafford or £2bn to build a completely new stadium, while the training ground needs around £100m in investment. That’s before prospective new owners even get round to investing in the playing squad, which is in need of a centre forward, central midfielder and goalkeeper. It raises significant fears for supporters that the Glazers will not give up ownership of the club. The Americans assumed control in 2005 and have saddled the club with debt, which stands at around £550m.
