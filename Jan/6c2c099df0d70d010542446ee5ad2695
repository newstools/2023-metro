Travel chaos has struck London at rush hour as multiple Tube lines reported ‘signal failures’ at the same time. TfL has taken the drastic measures to shut the Circle and Hammersmith and City lines due to signalling failures this evening. Trains were suspended between Richmond, Ealing Broadway and Upminster, Kensington Olympia and Earls Court, Wimbledon and Edgware Road on the District line Meanwhile, the Metropolitan line is also suspended between Wembley Park and Aldgate due to a failure. There are also severe delays on the District, Elizabeth and Jubilee lines due to faulty trains and signal failures. This means thousands of people who were heading home after work are left stranded in the cold. Commuters were pictured waiting for trains as they navigated the delays on the London Underground. Labour councillor, Andrew Achilleos, stressed ‘something needs to be done’ about the District line. He tweeted: ‘Here we go again. Wife cannot get home from work, and I will not be able to get out to work. ‘Something needs to be done about the District line. The transport infrastructure in east London is ridiculous.’ ‘Red signal on the District line, so they suspended District, Circle & Hammersmith,’ one passenger complained. ‘Because of this, everyone took the Jubilee line. Because of this, half of the Jubilee line is closed. Tell me if it makes sense.’ Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
