An asteroid the size of a bus is set to make one of the closest approaches ever recorded tonight. The space rock will zoom over the southern tip of South America just after midnight (GMT). Set to come in at only 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) above the planet’s surface, experts have noted that it’s a close shave. It’s predicted to be the fourth closest to pass by Earth since records began. But don’t worry – scientists have assured people that there’s no need to panic as it’s certain to miss. People can watch the close encounter on The Virtual Telescope Project from 7.15pm today. Estimated to be between 3.7 and 8.2 metres wide, the asteroid couldn’t do too much damage even if it did hit, it’s believed. It would likely turn into a fireball and largely disintegrate harmlessly in the atmosphere. Some of the bigger debris would potentially fall as small meteorites. The asteroid was discovered by G Borisov on January 21 and has been named asteroid 2023 BU. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
