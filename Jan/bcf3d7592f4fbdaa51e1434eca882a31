Arsenal winger Marquinhos is set to join Norwich City on loan for the rest of the season. The Gunners signed the 19-year-old in a £3 million deal from Sao Paulo last summer but opted to keep him at the club to help his adjustment to English football. Marquinhos has made six first-team appearances for Arsenal, primarily in their Europa League campaign, but has now been given the chance to secure regular minutes in the second half of the season. It’s understood that Arsenal have now agreed to send Marquinhos on loan to Norwich until the summer, while the Championship club do not have an option to permanently buy the Brazilian. Norwich currently sit sixth in the Championship but are 15 points off an automatic promotion place. The Gunners have already bolstered their midfield options this month with the £27m signing of Leandro Trossard from Brighton. But the Premier League leaders are also looking to recruit a new central midfielder before Tuesday’s transfer deadline. Two offers for Moises Caicedo have already been rejected by Brighton and Arsenal are now considering whether to increase their latest £70m bid. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
