Maya Jama has expressed how ‘overwhelmed’ she feels after making her debut as the new host of Love Island, while sharing some behind-the-scenes shots from the first episode. During last night’s episode of the 2023 series, Winter Love Island kicked off with the first coupling up ceremony of the show. Having taken over the role of presenter from Laura Whitmore, Maya, 28, showcased her best slow-mo walk as she entered the villa in South Africa for the first time, before greeting islanders including Ron Hall, Tanyel Revan, Kai Fagan and Lana Jenkins. Following the premiere, the TV personality shared a post on Instagram thanking fans for the immense support they’ve shown her. Uploading several pictures of herself in her already-iconic black cut-out dress, she wrote in the caption: ‘Overwhelmed from last night, thankyou so much for you’re kind words..’ The DJ then added a tease for the second instalment, writing: ‘Who’s ready for tonight’s episode ??’ A number of Maya’s celebrity friends voiced showered the star with adoration, including Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock, who commented: ‘Actual vision,’ alongside a fire emoji. Chicken Shop interviewer Amelia Dimoldenberg wrote: ‘You were amazing, a natural! The main reason I’m watching 😂.’ Samira Mighty, who competed on Love Island in 2018, remarked: ‘Unbelievable🔥,’ while reality star Vicky Pattison added: ‘Stunning mate 😍.’ She-Hulk star Jameela Jamil told Maya that she ‘Broke the internet. Broke the world,’ while several of Maya’s fans expressed their belief that the boys in the villa likely want to couple up with her. Tonight’s episode of Love Island is set to drum up some drama, following the arrival of bombshell Tom Clare. The footballer, who was given permission from his team to take part in the show, entered the villa after the first five couples had been formed. He’ll therefore have to crack on with getting to know the girls before deciding who he wants to couple up with, with his eventual decision set to leave one of the other boys vulnerable. However, yet another bombshell is going to be entering the villa, Ellie Spence, who’ll cause even more ripples. Love Island returns tonight at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. Got a story?
