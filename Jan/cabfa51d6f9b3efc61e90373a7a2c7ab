January is one of the most popular times to consider a new position or company – particularly as we slowly slip back into the mundane reality of ‘normal life’ again post-Christmas. And it seems a new job is top of the agenda for lots of Brits this year. According to new research, carried out by Reed.co.uk, 75% of UK workers will be job hunting this January – particularly with many pondering new year career resolutions. It also seems the cost of living crisis is making people reconsider what they do – and how much they earn – with 9% looking to move industry entirely. The data says that, currently, UK workers favour higher salaries over flexible working – as less than one in ten (8%) say they are looking for a role that offers a four-day working week. In terms of the specifics, HR (67%), IT (62%) and financial services (62%) are the sectors seeing the biggest movement at the moment. At the other end, the leisure and tourism sector is least likely to see staff move between roles, with only 27% revealing they are looking for a new job this year. Likewise, safety and security as well as marketing and PR are also set to see the least movement, as only 36% and 37% of workers within those industries respectively are looking to make a change. Although salary remains a top priority, (55%), workers are looking to move to achieve a better work-life balance (20%) and increased job security (13%). It’s also clear each generation has different priorities when job searching. On the whole, Gen Z (15%) want more career opportunities – whereas those aged 56 and over value work-life balance (16%).
