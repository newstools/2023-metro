Moises Caicedo has made it very clear that he wants to leave Brighton before the end of the January transfer window, posting a statement on social media confirming his intentions. Arsenal and Chelsea are interested in the midfielder, with the Gunners making a £60m bid for his services this month. The Ecuadorian is clearly keen to make the most of the interest and is already speaking like his Brighton days are in the past. The 21-year-old posted on Instagram and Twitter: ‘I am grateful to Mr. Bloom [owner and chairman] and Brighton for giving me the chance to come to the Premier League and I feel I have always done my best for them. I always play football with a smile and with heart. ‘I am the youngest of 10 siblings from a poor upbringing in Santa Domingo in Ecuador. My dream always to be the most decorated player in the history of Ecuador. ‘I am proud to be able to bring in a record transfer fee for Brighton which would allow them to reinvest it and help the club continue to be successful. ‘The fans have taken me into their hearts and they will always be in my heart so I hope they can understand why I want to take up this magnificent opportunity.’ Brighton are keen to keep hold of Caicedo, having already lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal this month. There is always a price that will force a sale, but the Seagulls are thought to want more like £80m for the Ecuadorian than the £60m that Arsenal have offered.
