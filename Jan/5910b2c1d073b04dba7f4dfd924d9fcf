A woman who wanted to get through to Evri’s customer service department came up with an elaborate plot to get their attention. Sani Shah, 27, called daily to track down two missing parcels she sent to customers of her clothes selling business, leaving her £200 out of pocket. She was rebuffed time and time again by a robot before starting a conversation on their live chat service. But after a month of back and forth she had enough. She said: ‘They gave me a reference number and said someone will be in touch, so I replied saying, “Help, your courier has set my house on fire!”. ‘They asked for two photos to start an investigation so I went on Google and found a house on fire. ‘People have messaged me saying it’s someone’s actual house but I just needed someone to ring me, I didn’t want to message. ‘The next day I got a call. It was a lady who sounded like she was from head office. They obviously saw the fire and thought, “Oh, this is serious.”’ Sani confessed but the worker took pity and gave her a refund so she could ship replacement items to the customers. Sani, from Milton Keynes, said: ‘I’m not trying to encourage lying and giving Evri stress but this is the extent people have to go to to get in touch.’ German-owned Evri – part of the Hermes group which changed its name after previous issues – apologised and blamed a third-party firm. It added: ‘We deliver 700million parcels a year and are proud that 99 per cent are delivered on time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
