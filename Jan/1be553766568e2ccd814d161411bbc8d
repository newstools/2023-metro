A man jailed for sexually abusing two children insisted he was instead trying to ‘educate’ them. An investigation into Melvyn Richardson, from Intake, in Doncaster, was launched in February 2020 after his victims came forward. One of them reported being sexually abused in the late 2000s, while the second in 2018. Sheffield Crown Court heard how the 68-year-old had told South Yorkshire Police he had only been ‘educating’ them. After a nine-day trial, he was found guilty of two counts of indecent assault, one count of indecency with a child, two counts of sexual assault on a child under 13, one count of causing and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of cruelty to a person under 16. Richardson was sentenced to 19 years in prison. One of his victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said they were ‘happy that justice had prevailed’. She added: ‘I would like to express my gratitude to everyone involved in securing a conviction against Richardson. ‘The resulting sentence of 19 years demonstrates the seriousness of his offences towards me, and the other victim. ‘I will forever be grateful for the hard work and dedication of both police forces to put this man behind bars.’ DC Carla Davey, who led the investigation, commended both victims for their bravery and patience. ‘Their courage and strength have been acknowledged by all officers involved,’ she said. ‘The passage of time should be no bar to victims of serious crime receiving the justice they deserve, nor should it be a veil for offenders to hide behind. ‘Victims must be assured that they will be listened to, and their allegations fully investigated, and this is a prime example of our determination to ensure the people of South Yorkshire can have confidence in us. ‘I would also like to thank North Wales Police for their continuous support over the last four years.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
