Jakub Kiwior has revealed why he picked Arsenal after the club officially announced the arrival of the Poland international from Italian side Spezia. The 22-year-old centre-back has become Mikel Arteta’s second January signing and heads to north London in a deal worth £20m. Kiwior, who has nine caps for Poland and has impressed in Serie A, has signed a four-and-a-half contract at the Emirates with the option of a further year. He started all four of Poland’s games at the World Cup in Qatar and follows Leandro Trossard in heading to Arsenal this month – who joined the Gunners from Brighton in a £27m deal. Kiwior spoke to the club media following his move to Arsenal and explained the reasons behind his mid-season switch – revealing that the Gunners’ style of football was a big factor. ‘When I saw my name on an Arsenal shirt for the first time, I just laughed!’ Kiwior said. ‘I was so happy to see my name on the shirt of such a huge club. ‘For me, it’s an incredibly happy moment and the pinnacle to play for such a big club. ‘I’ve always dreamt of playing in the Premier League. I knew it wouldn’t be easy, and if I got the chance, then I knew I’d have to make the most of it because it was one of my biggest dreams. For me, it’s the best league. I’m thrilled to be here. ‘It’s huge for me that Arsenal were interested and that I’m able to be here. I’m aware that Arsenal are a massive club in a top league, so I didn’t really have to think about much else. I was just ecstatic and really wanted to come. ‘I love passing the ball. I like teams that move the ball and try to create chances that way. So, I’m happy that I’ve come to a team like that.’ Arsenal are five points clear of the top of the Premier League following Sunday’s victory over Manchester United with a game in hand over Manchester City.
