Now January is here, lots of us will be spending time organising and prepping for the year ahead. Decluttering and sorting is a great way to get a head start on this and one woman has shared a nifty hack for storing clothes to help them smell fresher for longer. Julia, who posts vintage-inspired clothing and hacks under the username @_boringbb_, typically shares handy tips for vintage clothing – but her grandma recently informed her of another useful trick. She says in her TikTok: ‘Anyone else rip out those magazine fragrance testers and shove them in your drawers to keep your clothes smelling nice? I did up until a few months ago.’ Julia explains that when she was around her grandma’s house she saw bars of soap wrapped up in her drawers. When she asked her grandma why they were there, her relative answered: ‘”Oh honey, you didn’t know? That’s how you keep your clothes smelling nice.”‘ This resulted in her digging a little deeper to get some answers. Sharing her findings, Julia adds: ‘Apparently, if you take a nice neutral wrapped bar of soap, this one is lavender, but you can use cotton or whatever, it will last 15 to 20 years. ‘I had no idea but I tried it out for a few months and it’s amazing. My clothes smell amazing. Definitely give it a go.’ The TikToker stresses that you need a neutral soap and one that’s wrapped in paper, not plastic. She continues: ‘Try to find a scent that would not overwhelm someone and simply place it in the corner with your clothes or linens. ‘It will make everything very subtlety smell great and last so many years.’ Do you have a story to share?
