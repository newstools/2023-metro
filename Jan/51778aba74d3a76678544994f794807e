A lion tamer saved her husband’s life when he became embroiled in a fight between animals during a circus show in Russia. Alexey Makarenko, 42, was entertaining an audience of parents and children at the 1,200-seat Sochi State Circus when two male lions turned on each other. He stepped in to stop the brawl but a third lion leaped on him from behind before dragging him to the ground and mauling him inside the caged arena. His wife Olga Borisova, 43, rushed over with a whip to scare the beast as staff went into emergency mode, raising the lights, firing water cannon and detonating noise grenades. Mr Makarenko threw a stage prop at the departing animal as it was hustled off stage and took a bow alongside his wife, leaving some in the audience wondering whether it was all part of the act. But the lion had ‘clawed and sank its teeth’ into him, leaving him with gashes and deep bite marks on his shoulders and back. ‘As I tell my students, fighting lions are likely to unite and take part in the conflict,’ said Mr Makarenko’s colleague, Edgard Zapashny of the Great Moscow State Circus. ‘We must pay tribute to Alexei’s wife, trainer Olga Borisova, who reacted in time and saved her husband’s life. ‘Now Alexei is receiving medical care, but he will be back soon in the ring of the Sochi Circus with his handsome lions.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
