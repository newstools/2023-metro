Tottenham have submitted a €25 million (£21.9m) bid for Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Piero Hincapie, according to reports in Germany. Spurs completed a loan deal for Villarreal winger Arnaut Danjuma earlier this week but are still keen on bolstering Antonio Conte’s squad before the end of the transfer window. According to Bild, Tottenham have now made a verbal offer to Leverkusen to sign Hincapie this month. However, the report claims that Leverkusen are likely to demand more than the €25m (£21.9m) which Spurs have proposed. Leverkusen are in a strong negotiating position as Hincapie still has over three years remaining on his current contract with the Bundesliga club. The 21-year-old primarily plays as a centre-back but is also capable of playing on the left side of a defence. He has already been capped 24 times by Ecuador and impressed during their World Cup campaign in Qatar last month. Tottenham are also hopeful of completing a deal to sign Sporting CP right-back Pedro Porro. Reports in Portugal claim that Spurs have agreed a €48m (£41.1m) deal with Sporting, while Porro is now due to travel to London to finalise his move. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
