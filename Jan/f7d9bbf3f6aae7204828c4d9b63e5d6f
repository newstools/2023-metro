Coronation Street lines up another week of epic drama, with a number of shocks and surprises on the cards for the show’s finest. Teddy’s memories come flooding back and he remembers information about his showdown with Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce), much to Stephen’s horror. Conflict ensues, with Teddy later cornering Stephen in the factory, revealing that he reckons the killer is behind Leo’s death. Stephen retaliates, hitting Teddy over the head, claiming another victim in the process. Sickening. Summer Spellman’s (Harriet Bibby) life hang in the balance when Mike opens the door to the nursery to find her unconscious. Esther calls an ambulance, while Mike gives a false name to the hospital, but Aggie Bailey (Lorna Laidlaw) informs Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brockelbank) and Paul Foreman (Paul Foreman), who later arrive – demanding answers. Mike subsequently stops by the hospital again, and Paul and Todd Grimshaw (Gareth Pierce) confront him about it at his home, with Paul lashing out, attacking Mike, who hits his head. Is he dead? Elsehwere on the cobbles, Hope Stape (Isabella Flanagan) is devastated when the tape featuring John Stape’s voice unspools, but Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) comes to the rescue, unaware of what the tape is. When he and Fiz (Jennie McAlpine) press play, they’re horrified to hear the killer’s voice! Coronation Street airs these scenes w/c Monday January 16 on ITV1 and ITVX.
