A teenager has pleaded guilty to the murder of 14-year-old boy stabbed to death in south London. Jermaine Cools was wounded in London Road, near West Croydon train station, after a fight involving a number of people. He was rushed to hospital but died a short time later from multiple stab wounds. Jermaine was the youngest person to be stabbed and killed on the streets of the capital in 2021, a year in which 30 teenagers lost their lives. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, has pleaded guilty to his murder at a hearing in the Old Bailey. He had previously admitted possessing a knife in London Road, Croydon, on the same date. Jermaine’s family sat in Court Two on what would have been the first day of the defendant’s trial. Prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC suggested a provisional sentencing date of February 24. The facts of the case were not outlined and the defendant was remanded into custody. Got a story?
