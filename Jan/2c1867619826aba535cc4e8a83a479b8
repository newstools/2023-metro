A mum has claimed her son is ‘coming home hungry’ due to ‘terrible’ food being served at his secondary school. The mum, who did not want to be named, shared photos of her child’s meals, saying catering at Royds Hall School in Paddock, Huddersfield, hasn’t been good enough recently. She wrote: ‘The school dinners are terrible – my child is coming home hungry and he just showed me some of the school dinner for the past week. ‘When my child was in years 7 and 8 the school dinner was amazing; however, the school has got a cheaper food service called Mellors Catering and the food has just gone downhill.’ She also claimed students are only offered a 330ml bottle of water to drink. ‘I just wanted to let everyone know that the meals they are giving our children are terrible,’ she said. ‘Some children are going to school for that one meal of the day but don’t want to speak out.’ In a statement, the school said: ‘We take our responsibility to provide nutritious food very seriously. We check the standards frequently and listen carefully to any concerns raised by pupils, staff or parents. The feedback so far this year has been positive. ‘Our catering service offers a range of nutritious food. Pupils make their own selection from a range of hot and cold, main and side dishes, alongside a selection of sandwiches and jacket potatoes which are available daily, all served to the pupils by the catering team. ‘Pupils can choose from bottled mineral water or flavoured water.’ Catering company Mellors said: ‘We pride ourselves on using quality products and local suppliers for the provision of our school meals across the Share MAT [multi-academy trust] where we have worked in partnership feeding the pupils and staff for four years. ‘We comply with the food school standards to ensure that every meal served to our customers is healthy and nutritious.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
