A dog has incredibly survived falling off a 90ft cliff in Dorset. Penny the spaniel was being walked by her owner along Old Harry Rocks when she fell off the side of the rock formation on Saturday. After dropping, Penny crashed into the sea and managed to swim to safety. A local lifeboat managed to get to her at the base of the cliff, where she was  ‘pretty nervous but moving okay and running around,’ according to Becky Mack from Swanage RNLI. The lifeboat team then used the dog’s collar and lead to secure her. Despite having received a small bruise and being a little shaken, Penny was remarkably unharmed by her ordeal – though she was ‘very glad’ to return to her owner. A spokesman for Swanage Coastguard said: ‘On arrival the owner reported the dog had fallen from the right side of Old Harry but swam round to the left side where she was sat at the base of the cliff. ‘With the tide out the Coastguard team requested the launch of the Swanage Inshore Lifeboat as it would be safer than deploying a rope technician to the base of the cliff. ‘The Coastguard team lowered the dog’s collar and lead down the cliff to the lifeboat crew as often this helps calm the dog before being approached. ‘The lifeboat crew approached Penny and soon safely recovered her to the boat for a short trip to South Beach and a reunite with her owner. ‘Penny was a little cold and shocked after her ordeal and was being taken to a local vets to be checked after her 90ft fall.’ Swanage Coastguard have warned dog walkers to keep their pets on leads while near the cliff edges.
