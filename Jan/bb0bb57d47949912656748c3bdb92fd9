The X Factor star Ella Henderson has announced her engagement to Team GB swimmer Jack Burnell. The 26-year-old singer, who rose to fame in 2012 on the ITV competition, shared the exciting news to fans with a gorgeous picture beaming with her ring. ‘So this happened 💍☺️… here’s to life with you & all its adventures @jackrexburnell ♥️,’ she wrote. In another snap, the pair looked as loved up as ever while on a romantic holiday in Mauritius, wearing spa robes. Fans and friends rushed to share their congratulations in the comments, with Gordon Ramsay writing: ‘Congratulations to you both ❤️,’ while Giovanna Fletcher penned: ‘CONGRATULATIONS!!!! Xxxx’ Laura Whitmore echoed: ‘Congrats! ❤️xxx’ while Joel Corry wrote: ‘Woooo massive congrats to you both !!!’ Ella, who met Jack in 2020, previously told Metro.co.uk that their love blossomed over lockdown, calling Jack the ‘light’ in her life. ‘Who’d have thought in a pandemic you can grow and form a bond,’ she told Metro.co.uk while chatting about her single with Tom Grennan, Let’s Go Home Together. ‘For me it’s so difficult and so strange that it’s going to be one or the other, it’s either gonna bring you closer together or it’s going to draw you absolutely miles apart and I’m fortunate enough to say mine is the first one.’ She added: ‘He’s my best mate and I think it’s great because of what he does and what I do as a career, we understand one another because from such a young age we’ve made sacrifices in our own arenas. ‘He’s an athlete so he gets it from that perspective and I’m music so we both relate to one another but not too much, we don’t ever clash because if I had someone who constantly wanted to talk about music I think I’d go crazy.’ At the time, Ella also spoke about how her relationship with Jack was an inspiration for her second studio album, Chapter One, explaining: ‘It’s interesting because when I look back on the last two, three years of me, I suffer very badly with anxiety and panic attacks and I think when you’re in that you don’t know you’re in it and I couldn’t write about it then so I feel like now I’ve definitely opened up a lot in my writing sessions and I’ve written about those times as well. ‘What’s really nice is I feel like the album that’s to come is going to end in a way that’s quite hopeful because where I’m at in my life now, I just can’t believe that I’m here and surrounded by the people that I have.’ She added: ‘I think people will hear that transition of where light came into my life and I guess falling in love and feeling like I can completely be myself in that relationship which is an amazing thing when you find that.’ Got a story?
