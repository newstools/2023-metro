Arsenal are unwilling to meet Atletico Madrid’s asking price for Joao Felix and will end talks with the Spanish club unless they lower their demands. The Gunners are keen on signing a striker following injury to Gabriel Jesus, who is set to be sidelined for the next two months with a knee injury. Mikel Arteta’s side looked lacklustre in attack as they played out a 0-0 draw with Newcastle United on Tuesday night and their lack of options from the bench underlined the Spaniard’s desire to reinforce his attack. Arsenal have held talks with Atletico for Felix, who have decided to let the 23-year-old to leave the club after he fell out with Diego Simeone. The Portugal star joined the club for a fee of around £113m four years ago but he’s failed to develope in a way that once saw him viewed as the most talented youngster in world football. Nevertheless, he’s one of the few forward options on the market and Arteta feels he could help Arsenal’s title charge. But, with Atletico seeking £18.3m for a six-month loan, Arsenal have cooled their interest, according to Sky Sports. The Spanish club want Felix’s wages to be covered in full, along with a down payment of around £5m. This is considered excessive by the Gunners, who will drop their interest unless Atletico severely lower their demands. Manchester United, another interested party, share a similar view to Arsenal after talks with super agent Jorge Mendes.
