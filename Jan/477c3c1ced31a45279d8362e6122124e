Roy Keane has slammed Manchester United’s David de Gea for his mistake against Everton and says the goalkeeper ‘looks like he’s had a few drinks’. De Gea made a howler of an error in the first-half which led to a goal for the visiting Toffees as United legend Keane compared it to something out of a Carry On comedy movie. Everton’s Neal Maupay tried to cross from a narrow angle and the Spaniard inexplicably let the ball through his legs, leaving it for Conor Coady to tap in as United conceded for the first time since November. ‘It’s a shocking mistake,’ Keane told ITV at half-time. ‘It’s like Carry On football. Looks as if he’s had a few drinks. ‘Shocking mistake. It’s almost as if the goalkeeper has been sent off and an outfield player has gone in goal. He just doesn’t know what to do. Horrendous mistake.’ Lee Dixon, on ITV commentary duties for the match, watched De Gea’s mistake as it happened and added: ‘I can’t believe what I’ve seen. ‘David de Gea has had an absolute nightmare there. I’m not sure where he thinks the ball is going. ‘What is he doing there? He’s trying to let it go out for a goal kick. No idea… I cannot believe what I’ve just seen. ‘He’s probably the best goalkeeper in the world at making saves with his feet but on that occasion, just put your gloves on it!’ Former Everton defender Alan Stubbs told BBC Radio Merseyside: ‘It’s a mistake from De Gea after a bit of a nothing ball from Maupay. ‘He thinks it’s going out, doesn’t react and the ball goes through his legs and Coady was there. It is a shocking mistake from David de Gea.’ Meanwhile, Jack Butland is relishing the prospect of ‘competing with’ and ‘supporting’ De Gea at Old Trafford after completing his loan move to Manchester United.
