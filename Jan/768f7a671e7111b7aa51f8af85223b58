It’s a sleepy Sunday in terms of strikes – with just one industry staging industrial action today. Workers at drinks giant Diageo are also walking out over money after the company lowered the rate of pay for new-starters without consulting unions. Unite estimates some of its members could lose 6% of their pay. Diageo has previously said the action only involves 10 people. Next week will bring with it the return of strikes across various workplaces however. Teachers, rail workers, university staff, civil service employees and London Underground union members will all be downing tools. Yesterday, British Museum workers also announced proposed strike action. More than 100 workers will walk out during the February half term. Staff at the museum’s visitor services and security teams will be on the picket line for seven days starting from February 13. Members of the Public and Commercial Service union (PCS) at the famous museum are taking industrial action over a long-running dispute over jobs, pay and pensions.
