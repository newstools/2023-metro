Prince Harry was made to feel ‘less important than Prince William by being given fewer sausages at breakfast’, Princess Diana’s former butler has revealed. Paul Burrell, 64, said a young Harry asked ‘how come he gets three’ at breakfast-time, after the Princes’ nanny served up their meal. The nanny allegedly replied: ‘William needs filling up more than you. He’s going to be king one day.’ Paul said the incident helped form an early rivalry. He told The Sun: ‘When I look back now, I think maybe I was glimpsing the dynamic at play. ‘One time I saw the nanny give William three sausages at breakfast and Harry had two. ‘And Harry would look at his plate and say, how come he gets three? And I only get two.’ The butler said Harry would become quiet but had no choice but to ‘suck it up’. This helped form Harry’s resentment towards the Royal Family and the institution, culminating in the release of the Duke of Sussex’s controversial memoir Spare. According to Paul, Harry was constantly compared to his older brother while at Eton, making him want to become the class clown in order to be noticed. But the former butler does believe Harry has gone too far in his attacks on his family, saying he has ‘lost the plot’. He said: ‘He’s clearly hurt and angry at being “the spare” and so he’s lashing out from that place. ‘He’s lobbing in all these resentment-filled grenades, and hurting a lot of people in the process. ‘I know the Queen was upset in the months before she died and worried about accusations coming her way across the Atlantic.’ Paul added he believed Diana would be ‘appalled’ over her son’s attacks, and furious to find out he had taken drugs. Now, he believes The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s royal titles should be taken away from them. ‘Their only USP is being royal so take away their royal status and nobody will want to know them,’ he said.
