Princes William and Harry didn’t want their dad to marry Camilla, according to the Duke of Sussex. In the biography, Spare, he described contemplating the prospect of the now-Queen Consort becoming their ‘wicked stepmother’. The explosive excerpt was made public days before the book is due to go on sale to the public after The Sun managed to buy a copy that was released early in Spain. He describes her appearing ‘bored’ during the sit-down, which he says was ‘pure formality’ because he was not the heir or a major obstacle, according to the newspaper. Harry reportedly claims he and William promised Charles they would welcome Camilla into the family. But in exchange they ‘begged’ him not to get married a second time following the death of their mother, Diana. He writes that the King did not respond to the request. The prince alleges he and his brother worried about Camilla being unfairly compared to Diana. He also claims that, despite their protestations, a campaign subsequently took off for the marriage to take place and for Camilla to become eventually become Queen. Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have declined to comment on the leaked claims, which have emerged five days before the book is due to be published. In other excerpts obtained by the Guardian newspaper, the duke claims he was physically attacked by his brother and knocked to the floor during a furious confrontation over the Duchess of Sussex. Harry also alleges that it was William and the Princess of Wales who encouraged him to wear a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party 2005 and ‘howled’ with laughter when they saw it.
