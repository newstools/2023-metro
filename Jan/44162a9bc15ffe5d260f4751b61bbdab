Christian Eriksen left Old Trafford on crutches after Manchester United’s win over Reading in the FA Cup on Saturday evening. The Denmark international was forced off early in the second half of United’s 3-1 victory against the Championship club after he was hacked down by Andy Carroll. Eriksen was replaced by Fred but concerns over the severity of his ankle injury have been raised after supporters watched the 30-year-old hobble away from Old Trafford on crutches following the win in the FA Cup fourth round. United have just begun a hectic run of fixtures in which they play 10 matches in 32 days and will be hoping Eriksen makes a swift recovery. When asked about Eriksen’s injury after the game, Ten Hag said: ,’It’s always difficult to say in this moment so short after the game has finished. ‘But it’s an ankle [injury]. We have to see what is the diagnosis, so it costs us a minimum of 24 hours before we know that and then I can say more.’ A double from Casemiro and a goal from Fred secured the win for United over Reading and after the game, Ten Hag hailed the impact that Casemiro has made since his arrival from Real Madrid at the start of the season. ‘We know he’s a great player and that midfield at Real Madrid, with Kroos and Modric, it was great,’ Ten Hag said. ‘He’s capable of that [scoring goals]. We see him as a part of it offensively and he enjoys it as well, when he can come [into] it. ‘What I like is dynamic football with variations, with many positional switches so we have to make the opponent think so that we can take the benefit of it. ‘Casemiro is magnificent. In front of the back line, always taking good positions, in and out of position. And he can deal with the ball, he can give the right pass. So, he can accelerate the game and if necessary, he can score.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
