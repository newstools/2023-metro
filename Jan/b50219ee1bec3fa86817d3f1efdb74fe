Several senior Ukrainian officials have quit after president Volodymyr Zelensky pledged a shake-up amid allegations of corruption during the war with Russia. They included Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the president’s deputy head of office, who had worked on Mr Zelensky’s election campaign that promised to tackle corruption. He had been under investigation for his personal use of luxury cars and was among officials linked to the embezzlement of £5.7million aid earmarked for the southern Zaporizhzhia region last September. Mr Tymoshenko denies the allegations. He asked to be relieved of his duties, according to a decree signed by Mr Zelensky. No reason was given. Deputy defence minister Viacheslav Shapovalov also resigned. Reports allege his decision was linked to a scandal involving the purchase of food for Ukrainian armed forces. Deputy prosecutor general Oleksiy Symonenko has also quit. The resignations follow the sacking of deputy infrastructure minister Vasyl ­Lozynsky – accused of taking a £322,000 bribe to fix rebuilding ­contracts. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine called him part of ‘an organised criminal group’. Mr Zelensky said he intended Mr Lozynksy’s sacking to send ‘a signal to all those whose actions or behaviour violate the principle of justice’. Meanwhile, Russian shelling has killed one civilian and wounded two near Bakhmut in the east. A woman was killed and three others wounded in the northern Sumy region.
