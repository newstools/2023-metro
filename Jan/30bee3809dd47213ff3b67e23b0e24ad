An urgent hunt to find a convicted arsonist, 19, who is on the run has been going for more than two days now. Johnny Brady fled a mental health hospital in Northampton around 3.30pm on New Year’s Eve. Police fear the teen may have started three separate fires since escaping the grounds of St Andrew’s Healthcare facility, in Billing Road. They said on Sunday they are investigating three incidents of arson to bags of rubbish, which happened in the night. But there have been no confirmed sightings of Brady since he left the hospital and immediate area. The criminal was serving a hospital order following convictions relating to serious assault and arson offences. People have been urged not to approach him if they see him, and instead call police. Brady is white, about 5ft 9ins and of a slim build. He was last seen wearing black Adidas tracksuit bottoms, a black hoodie, and black coloured trainers. Detective Superintendent Richard Tompkins said: ‘Johnny is serving a hospital order for convictions relating to arson and serious assault, which is why it is very important that the public do not approach him under any circumstances but should call 999 immediately. ‘We are investigating three separate incidents of arson to bags of rubbish, which occurred overnight, in areas within a couple of miles of the hospital grounds which may be linked to Johnny. ‘Arson has potentially fatal consequences and we therefore ask the public to be extra vigilant within their local communities. ‘If you see anyone acting suspiciously near property or deliberately starting fires to items such as bins, please call us immediately on 999.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
