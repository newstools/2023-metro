Playtime is over for London’s oldest toy museum after more than five decades. Pollock’s in Fitzrovia sadly announced it would have to relocate after a ‘change in circumstances’ regarding the building’s ownership. Jack Fawdry-Tatham, the museum’s owner, reassured fans that Pollock’s would stay active on social media while its physical premises were closed, showcasing toys and projects from its extensive archive. It was founded by Fawdry-Tatham’s great-grandmother who bought up the entire stock of a nineteenth-century toy theatre shop. After first opening in Covent Garden, the museum relocated to Fitzrovia in 1969 as gentrification drove up prices. In March 2021, the museum raised £41,568 from 812 donors to modernise the site and provide a new online ticket service. But the improvements haven’t attracted enough visitors to keep the museum going in its current Georgian building, and the attraction is now looking for a new home.
