A woman was mauled to death by the dogs she was walking at a popular Surrey beauty spot. Police were called to Gravelly Hill in Caterham on Thursday afternoon where the 28-year-old woman, from London, sadly died at the scene. A second woman, who is thought to have tried to help, also needed treatment after suffering dog bites but has since been discharged from hospital. Eight dogs have been detained by officers and remain under the charge of the police. The woman’s next of kin have been informed, and they are being supported by specialist officers. No arrests have been made. Roads in the area remain cordoned off while police carry out forensic work. Inspector Lyndsey Whatley, Borough Commander for Tandridge, said: ‘This is a tragic incident where a young woman has sadly lost her life and our thoughts are with her family and friends. ‘I know that yesterday’s events will be of real concern to the local community and I would like to reassure residents that we are confident all the dogs involved are in the custody of police whilst we investigate the circumstances of what has happened. ‘Officers will remain in the area of Gravelly Hill today whilst enquiries continue and if you have any information but have not yet spoken to police then please contact us.’ Claire Coutinho, the MP for East Surrey, said: ‘My thoughts are with the loved ones of the lady who has died following a dog attack in Caterham. ‘Thank you to the paramedics for their efforts at the scene and officers from Surrey Police who controlled the situation so quickly.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
