A dog that has become renowned for nicking objects is back from the vets after guzzling down a remote control. Hank, a two-year-old Rottweiler, was dubbed ‘the UK’s most prolific canine klepto’ by owner Colin Hatley-Ayre thanks to his mischievous habit. Since he was picked up as an eight-week-old puppy, he’s stolen toy cars, magnets, bubble wrap, underwear, sponges, teddies and doorstops to hide in his basket. But Hank got into a different kind of trouble earlier this month, when Colin caught him chewing away at the family’s TV remote control. Luckily, he managed to get it out of Hank’s mouth before he reached the potentially lethal batteries. Colin said: ‘He will usually stash his finds under his blanket but this time he was caught in the act.’ Hank was whisked off to the vets in Grimsby and given an x-ray and an enema to wash out the small pieces of black plastic. No serious issues were found, and Hank was sent back home with some pain relief and his tail between his legs. Colin said: ‘Luckily not too much damage was done, except for the remote, and he seems fine in himself now. ‘We’ve spotted a couple of rubber numbers come out so hopefully he is over the worst and has learned a valuable lesson.’ Charlotte Hailstones, a veterinary nurse at Blue Cross Grimsby, said: ‘It was fortunate that Hank’s owner got hold of the remote before too much damage was done. ‘Batteries can be extremely dangerous if a dog swallows or pierces them. ‘Not only can batteries cause an obstruction, if pierced they can lead to extremely painful chemical burns inside their mouth and oesophagus.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
