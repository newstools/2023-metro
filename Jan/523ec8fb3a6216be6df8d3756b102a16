Maya Jama has officially touched down in South Africa ahead of the new series of Love Island and we can almost hear the opening credits now. The adored ITV2 dating show is set to return to television screens on January 16 for its sizzling winter edition, and our new host, 28, is getting ready for all of the action. Keeping her followers up to date with her movements, Maya shared seven photos on her Instagram including a selfie while aboard her 11-hour flight to Cape Town. The presenter oozed comfortable chic as she dressed in grey tracksuit bottoms with a matching hoodie and a green t-shirt. She also kept a low profile in a pair of black sunglasses and flashed the peace sign as she stepped foot on South African soil. Maya also appeared to be living the high life on the plane and sat down to watch West Ham take on Brentford as she jetted to much warmer climes. ‘overnight flight, ello South Africa✌🏽 ‘ she captioned her post. Maya has taken over the Love Island reins from Laura Whitmore, 37, who announced she was stepping down in August. The television personality recently shared that she immediately accepted the offer to host the show after getting the call while on holiday. ‘Once you start doing TV, you meet a lot of producers, through different shows, and the heads will be aware of talent, that’s weird to call yourself talent, isn’t it?’ she told The Times. ‘I talk for a living. It’s not exactly tap dancing everywhere or performing a ballad. So I think I’ve always been in their eye line, but I was super young when the presenter shifts were happening in the past. ‘They knew about me but I was always a bit too young, and obviously, there were previous hosts anyway. Then, this year, I got a phone call while I was in America.’ Talking about her preparations for the show, she added: ‘I am shy about that walk. It’s big, isn’t it, the slow-motion walk? Me and my girlfriends, we were drunk, doing the walk, up and down the hall. Tried the sexy version. Tried the smiley version. Smiley version won.’ Love Island is set to return to ITV2 on January 16.
