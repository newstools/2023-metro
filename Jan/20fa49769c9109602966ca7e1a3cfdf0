Antonio Conte believes Arsenal and Manchester City are the only two teams capable of winning the Premier League title this season after Spurs’ defeat in the north London derby. Mikel Arteta’s side are now eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after their 2-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday. Arsenal are now, for the first time this season, named as favourites to win the league with the bookmakers as they look to win their first league title since 2004. And Conte believes Arsenal have what it takes to beat current champions City this season. ‘Arsenal showed they are a really good team and I think honestly I’m sure that today it wasn’t easy for them to play against us, especially with this atmosphere,’ Conte told Sky Sports after Spurs’ defeat to Arsenal. ‘They have a great balance and hit the right moments. In the second half they suffered a lot and showed their resilience and when a team can do this it means they are ready to fight for a title. ‘I think with Manchester City they are the only two teams who are going to fight for the Premier League this season.’ Arteta, meanwhile, believes Arsenal will need to go above the 100-point barrier in order to beat City to the title. ‘One hundred per cent yes, I do,’ Arteta said. ‘I don’t want to do too many calculations. It’s how we are going to prepare for the game against Man United now, to get another three points and play well and deserve to win. ‘You ask me about points but it’s happened in the last four or five seasons so it will demand almost perfection.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
