To say speculation is rife that Molly-Mae Hague has given birth would be an understatement – and now boyfriend Tommy Fury has spoken out. The couple – who met on Love Island in 2019 – set the internet alight last year by announcing that they were expecting their first child, a baby girl, together. Molly-Mae, 23, has kept fans updated with the highs and lows of pregnancy, meaning fans of the PrettyLittleThing creative director are incredibly invested in the birth of this child! And it seems Jake Paul may have let their big news slip before Molly-Mae and Tommy, also 23, were able to reveal it. With Tommy’s representative having confirmed that his long-awaited boxing fight against Jake will be taking place on February 26 in Saudi Arabia, his opponent has already come out with the fighting talk. In a tweet, Jake said: ‘Tommy has no excuses now…Baby’s born. ‘Money’s massive. Immigration no issue. Tyson promises he & Papa will make Tommy retire from boxing & change his last name if he can’t beat the YouTuber.’ He added: ‘Tmw I’m coming to London to look at all 3 Fury’s in the eye & shake on that promise.’ However, when asked about the rumours at a press conference this weekend, Tommy kept schtum. Speaking at Wembley Stadium, the boxer said: ‘I will be making no comment on that.’ Fans have been convinced that the reality TV stars are now parents after Molly-Maes’ silence on social media. Her last post on Instagram was on January 20, and it seemed very much like a love letter to her future daughter and a goodbye to her pregnancy. ‘I really couldn’t have asked my body to provide a better home for the first 9 months of our little girls life…’, she wrote, posing in a dressing gown and cradling her belly. ‘So blessed to say my pregnancy has been a complete and utter dream 👼🏼’ The influencer – who boasts 6.9million followers – also recently posted a YouTube video in which she showed fans what’s inside her hospital bag. Ahead of her baby’s arrival, the heavily pregnant star revealed that she would actually be giving birth in London and not in Cheshire. Going through the contents of her bag, she first pulled out her most sentimental item – her favourite stuffed animal Ellie Belly, which was introduced during her season five stint on Love Island. As she reached other items, including hygiene products and headphones, she added: ‘When we return home from this trip, we are returning with a little baby. So this is going to be the best trip of a lifetime.’ Got a story?
