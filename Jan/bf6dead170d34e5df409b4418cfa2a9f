A 100-year-old woman has revealed the secret to a long life is ‘not speaking to strange men’. Olive Westerman celebrated the landmark milestone with an afternoon tea at the Deewater Grange care home in Chester. The centenarian had lived an action-packed life, spending time in Singapore and then travelling the world with writer and travel clerk husband Sam. She worked as a nursery nurse and added that being around children helped to kept her young at heart. Olive, from South Kirby, West Yorkshire said: ‘Avoid talking to strange men and you’ll be just fine. ‘I think that the best advice I could give is simply to be happy and content to be alive, and to make the most of what you have. ‘Over the years I have spent a lot of time working with children, and this will certainly help to keep you young at heart.’ Staff at her care home carried on a tradition started by her late husband Sam, and gifted her a bottle of Estee Lauder perfume. Olive recalled: ‘Me and my husband met at the local church we used to attend every Sunday. ‘We got chatting one day after mass and we hit it off immediately. ‘What I loved about him most was his kind and gentle nature, and the fact he was always trying to help others.’ Olive also got given a box of Lindor chocolates to enjoy – as well as a very special birthday card. She added: ‘I actually can’t believe I’m now 100, but it feels amazing. ‘I was absolutely thrilled to receive a card from King Charles and Camilla.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
