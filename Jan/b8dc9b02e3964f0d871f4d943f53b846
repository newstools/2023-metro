A business owner was left stunned when a blockage in his pipes emerged to be a snake in a drain. Staff at the shop – on Pershore High Street in Worcestershire – previously thought the drain was simply blocked with leaves. Luckily, Hinton Pest Control came to the rescue. In a statement, the company said: ‘We are on call over the festive period and we were called by a local business owner who originally thought they had some kind of issue with their guttering and downpipe. ‘They didn’t know what to do so they called us and we were able to head down and get him safely into the pillow.’ Footage shows the terrifying moment the creature was caught after it slithered up a drainpipe. After it was rescued, the snake was taken to a vet to see if it had been microchipped. Hinton Pest Control added: ‘We took him to De Montfort Veterinary Surgery in Pershore and discovered he was not microchipped. ‘He was in good health apart from being slightly underweight. ‘We are now in the process of trying to reunite him with his owner.’ The snake in the drain came after a snake was spotted on a train. In the latter case, the reptile was found on a carriage travelling around south-east England. It was spotted slithering along the carriage of a Southern Rail train by staff at the Selhurst Train Depot in Croydon, south London. The service had been travelling between London, Kent and Sussex for weeks until the unexpected stowaway was discovered. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
