A father was arrested after his four-year-old son was shown waving a loaded handgun outside his apartment on live TV. Footage from a neighbour’s Ring doorbell cam of the youngster holding the pistol in Beech Grove, Indiana, was broadcast on the reality TV show ‘On Patrol: Live’, which follows police officers on duty, on Saturday. The boy can be seen pulling the trigger at one point but no bullets were fired, CNN reports. He did not appear to be harmed. Police later seized a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun. While no rounds were in the chamber, there were 15 in the magazine. The boy’s father, Shane Osborne, 45, was arrested on a charge of neglect and is due in court on Tuesday afternoon, according to the New York Post. A neighbour had called 911 ‘stating she and her son had witnessed the child alone in the hallway outside their unit, and that he had been holding a gun and pointing it at them’. Beech Grove Mayor Dennis Buckley said in a statement: ‘As with all of you, I’m mortified and what took place and I’m so thankful that no one was hurt, especially the young child. ‘I appreciate the quick action taken by the Beech Grove Police Department to secure the small child and the gun in question. ‘I ask that the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office work tirelessly to secure charges and a conviction against the responsible parties, with maximum penalties. Society shouldn’t accept anything less.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
