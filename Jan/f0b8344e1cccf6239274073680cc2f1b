Students can take a break from pasta and baked beans thanks to Nando’s, who are now giving students 20% off their meals. It’s no secret that the cost-of-living crisis is having a huge impact – and if you’re a strapped for cash student, eating out isn’t always an option. But everyone’s favourite chicken restaurant is running the discount at student-friendly hours (pre-5pm and on select weekdays), which makes for a fun lunch with pals between classes. All you need to do is sign up online and you’re good to go – as long as you’re over 16. A chicken wrap for £7.50 goes down to £6, and halloumi sticks drop from £4.25 to £3.40. This is the first time ever the brand has introduced a student discount, and it’s a follow up to last summer’s free chicken offer on results day. On Twitter, one excited student wrote: ‘Nandos student discount best believe I’m going every week’. Another said: ‘Nandos getting rid of blue light discount but bringing student discount. Winning!’ Some think they’ll struggle with the temptation, as one wrote: ‘nandos introduced student discount :( i wanted to save my money’. Running in January during exam season, students in the UK and Ireland can treat themselves without denting their wallets so much. Are you tempted? Available from 9th January to eat-in at any Nando’s restaurant across the UK and Ireland from 11:30am – 5pm from Monday to Wednesday. Do you have a story to share?
