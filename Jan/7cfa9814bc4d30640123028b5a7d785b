At last, the age-old question has been answered – we know the nation’s favourite Tesco meal deal. Or rather, we know the most bought main/snack/drink combos purchased under the supermarket’s meal deal moniker. Thanks to a new feature being rolled out for Tesco Clubcard members called ‘Clubcard Unpacked’, customers are being treated to a year-in-review of their shopping for 2022. A Spotify unwrapped but for your lunch, if you will. The personalised summary includes your most-bought products, favourite meal deal combinations, and your favourite supermarket aisle. Clubcard Unpacked has also shared with the world what the UK’s favourite meal deals are, and they’re definitely… interesting. Coming in close to the top were the mains Tesco Chicken Club Sandwich and Tesco Chicken Bacon and Stuffing Sandwich. Walkers Cheese and Onion Crisps and Fridge Raiders Southern Style Chicken Bites were among the favourite snacks, and the Strawberry Ufit High Protein Milkshake and Lucozade Energy Orange dominated the drinks purchases. And the combo that came out on top last year? The UK’s most-bought meal deal doesn’t feature any sweet treats or fruit – juiced or otherwise. There aren’t any vegetables either, unless you count potatoes. The favoured main was a Sausage, Bacon & Egg Triple Sandwich. For the snack, the UK preferred McCoy’s Flame Grilled Steak crisps, and the top tier drink was a 500ml Coca-Cola. So what do you think of this meaty combo? Do you have a story to share?
