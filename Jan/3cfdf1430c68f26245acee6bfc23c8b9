Jurgen Klopp has confirmed Virgil van Dijk will be out for at least a month after suffering a hamstring injury during Liverpool’s Premier League defeat to Brentford. Van Dijk, who played in every Liverpool league game this season, was taken off at half-time in Monday’s 3-1 defeat in west London. The Netherlands defender was sent to a specialist to assess the extent of the injury, with Klopp now confirming the diagnosis is ‘pretty harsh’. Asked for an update on Van Dijk, Klopp said on Friday: ‘It’s a big blow. He didn’t feel a lot and I took him off just because of the risk really. ‘In the end the diagnosis is pretty harsh. We’re talking about more than a month. Hopefully it goes quick but we will have to see. For now he’s not unavailable and that’s the way it is. ‘For Virgil obvious it’s hard but he’s played an incredible amount of game over the years. We can’t use him on the pitch at least but we will use him off the pitch.’ Liverpool’s defeat at Brentford leaves them sixth in the Premier League, seven points outside the Champions League places and 16 points behind leaders Arsenal. Klopp’s side have been hampered by a number of injuries this season, with Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz still out following setbacks before the World Cup. Liverpool face Premier League rivals Wolves in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday and Klopp says he will pick his strongest possible side. ‘We played on Monday, now Saturday. We will line up as strong as we can,’ Klopp added. ‘We always did, but with Monday/Saturday, there will not be a rotation because of different competitions.’ MORE : Jurgen Klopp gives positive Cody Gakpo update ahead of Liverpool debut MORE : Jurgen Klopp rejects claims Liverpool have approached Jude Bellingham For more stories like this, check our sport page.
