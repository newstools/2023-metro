A man who used an axe to attack a woman in a hairdressers has been jailed for 31 years. Bogdan Serban, 42, burst into the salon, in Coventry, on June 3 last year. His horrific attack left the woman with injuries to her face and both arms, as well as a fractured eye socket. Serban also used a knife in the targeted assault. The 42-year-old was sentenced at Coventry Crown Court on January 6 after being found guilty by a jury of the attempted murder of the woman. Officers had tried to show him the injuries the woman he attacked sustained, but he refused to look and said he could not remember hitting her with the axe. When Serban was asked about the knife in a police interview, he claimed it was used to ‘peel apples’. On the axe, he said he had bought it three or four days earlier and had not previously used it. DC Sunita Sharma, from the Complex Investigations Team in Coventry, said: ‘This was a violent and unprovoked attack and we welcome this sentencing. ‘The attack caused life-changing injuries and we hope the victim and her family can take some comfort knowing justice has been done.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
