An incredible Californian mansion with stunning views of LA has hit the market for £13million. But perhaps the real point of interest is that it’s propped up on 60-foot stilts. Garcia House was designed by renowned architect John Lautner and was originally built in 1962 – though has since undergone renovations. The towering property boasts three bedrooms, three bathrooms, enormous living spaces and, of course, plenty of windows to take in the views. If that wasn’t enough, it also has an entryway made of lava rock, original terrazzo flooring and a 55-foot wall of windows. So it’s safe to say it has points of interest at every turn. Also, if you head outside, the hillside steps will take you through the verdant garden – designed by landscape architect John Sharp – and to the swimming pool. It’s currently on the market with Aaron Kirman, Weston Littlefield, and Dalton Gomez of AKG, Christie’s International Real Estate. The listing for the impressive home reads: ‘60-foot caissons elevating the structure above the canyon showcase breathtaking panoramic views of Los Angeles. ‘Capture your place in history and experience a home that truly transcends time.’ Elsewhere in the world of property, a house is up for auction in London for £40,000 – but there’s a catch.
