The cost of applying for a British passport is set to rise next month. It comes as the government is set to introduce new passport fees for all applications on February 2, which will impact those newly applying or renewing their passport. Standard applications are set to rise from £75.50 to £82.50 for adults and £49 to £53.50 for children. Postal applications will rise from £85 to £93 for adults and £58.50 to £64 for children. The government web page says: ‘The new fees will help the Home Office move towards a system that meets its costs through those who use it, reducing reliance on funding from general taxation. ‘The government does not make any profit from the cost of passport applications. ‘The fees will also contribute to the cost of processing passport applications, consular support overseas, including for lost or stolen passports, and the cost of processing British citizens at UK borders. ‘The increase will also help enable the government to continue improving its services.’ It is the first time in five years the cost has risen the Home Office confirmed, adding the proposals are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
