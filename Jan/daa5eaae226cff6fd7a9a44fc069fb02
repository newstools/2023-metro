A lucky punter has won more than £19,000 after betting just £5 on a ridiculously long odds accumulator. The unnamed customer remarkably predicted the result of 25 football matches with bookmaker William Hill. To put that into perspective, they had a 0.026% chance of it coming through. They picked games from leagues in England, Scotland, Spain, Greece, Portugal, India, Italy, Turkey and Belgium. After all 25 teams obliged, they were celebrating taking home £19,575.79. William Hill spokesperson Lee Phelps said: ‘It’s pretty rare that five or six-team accumulators come off, so when we saw a 25-leg one cop on Sunday, we had to take our hat off to the lucky punter. ‘They managed to correctly predict the results of 25 matches across several leagues around the world and they must have felt pretty chuffed having turned £5 into over £19k.’ There have been some sensational punts in recent years, including a canny pensioner who won more than £2,600 after betting 3p on a 10-fold accumulator. George Wagonback’s stake was so small most betting shops wouldn’t have accepted it, and with odds just shy of 90,000 to 1, it was a long shot. But the 85-year-old granddad was jumping for joy as he read the football scores in the paper the following day. A few years back, another punter bagged a life-changing £574,278.41 with a £1 bet. The housewife randomly picked a 12-fold football accumulator because she was fed up with her husband and son watching TV matches all the time. Her son apparently read out the fixture list and she chose 12 teams she liked the sound of. She had quite the ‘if you can’t beat them, join them’ attitude.
