Another unsuspecting car has been impaled on anti-terror bollards marking yet another accident around the defence system. The bollards were introduced in Canterbury city centre two years ago, and have claimed many vehicles since. The latest, a Honda Accord, saw its rear wheels raised in the air as the driver tried to drive past the blocks. Dozens of similar incidents have occurred across the city since the £789,000 system was introduced in 2021 on the advice of the city council. Statistics revealed last year by KentOnline showed how 79 vehicles found themselves stranded by the posts in the first 18 months – including a police car. A local shop manager blamed motorists for ignoring signs warning of the bollards, yet tailgating drivers often found themselves stuck. ‘It says no tailgating and only one at a time, so obviously what’s happening is one is trying to get through behind the other,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t matter how much signage you put up, it’s whether people read it properly or understand it. We have a lot of foreign visitors who may not speak or read English.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
