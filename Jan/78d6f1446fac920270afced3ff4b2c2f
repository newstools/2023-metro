A Porsche driver had a fortunate escape when a jagged fence post smashed through his car and speared into his seat just an inch from his head. Photos showed how the driver only just avoided being impaled after his luxury Boxster sports car lost control during a country drive. Eyewitnesses told of seeing the post sticking through the windscreen above the steering wheel and above the headrest. But the motorist managed to end up with only minor cuts and bruises. The crash happened on a country road in the Welsh village of Shirenewton in Monmouthshore at 10.50am last Saturday. One witness said: ‘The driver hit the kerb and hedgerow and the fence saved him from entering the adjoining field. ‘Upon hitting the fence, this then broke up causing it to go through the driver’s door window, through the driver’s headrest and push through the rear window.’ He told how the the car – a Boxster 987 thought to be worth more than £50,000 – was badly damaged on the front driver’s side and at the rear, adding: ‘Luckily at the time there was no other road user. ‘The driver got away with what looked like a minor cut above his right ear and the passenger a minor cut by his left ear. ‘Both driver and passenger were very very lucky – the driver was less than one inch from being impaled through his head.’ Gwent Police officers attended the scene and were investigating, though said the driver did not seek medical attention.
