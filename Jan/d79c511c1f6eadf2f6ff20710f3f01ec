Rio Ferdinand believes Harry Maguire should leave Manchester United and feels the defender has been disrespected by Erik ten Hag after Luke Shaw was played instead of him in central defence last month. Maguire has started just four Premier League matches this season, with Ten Hag preferring Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez as his preferred centre-back partnership. The United captain also saw Shaw play ahead of him alongside Varane for two games last month after Martinez was given an extended break after Argentina’s World Cup success in Qatar. United have already dismissed reports linking Maguire with a surprise move to Aston Villa this month. But Ferdinand insists Maguire will be unhappy with how he has been treated by ten Hag at Old Trafford. ‘If you’re him you have to leave now,’ Ferdinand said of Maguire on Vibe With Five. ‘Luke Shaw’s playing centre-back instead of him. ‘That’s like me going back after the World Cup, playing well, everyone saying he’s done really well, and Patrice Evra is playing centre-back. ‘I’d want to strangle Patrice! I would’ve smashed Patrice in training to make sure he’s not available, and I’d be going to the manager and saying, ‘are you taking the piss out of me, boss?’. I’d have walked straight into the manager’s office and said, ‘you’re disrespecting me’. ‘Harry Maguire’s got to move. I think he stays because of the games and they can’t get someone else in. He plays in the cup games.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
