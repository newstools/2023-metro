Jurgen Klopp has denied reports claiming that Liverpool have held direct talks with Jude Bellingham over a move to Anfield. The England international has attracted widespread interest following his rapid rise at Borussia Dortmund and is expected to be one of the most in-demand midfielders during the summer transfer window. During the World Cup, reports claimed that Liverpool had moved ahead of Real Madrid in the race to sign Bellingham after Klopp held positive talks with the 19-year-old’s family. But when asked if he had spoken to Bellingham’s entourage, Klopp told SportBILD: ‘These things are not possible because he is under contract with Borussia Dortmund. ‘That is not possible without their consent. So it’s not true. ‘Jude is a great player who we are familiar with, of course. We’d be stupid not to have him on our radar. But there’s nothing more to say at the moment.’ Meanwhile, Klopp admits Liverpool have an ‘insanely difficult’ task of finishing in the Premier League top four this season. ‘Reaching the Champions League is of course extremely important for us,’ said Klopp. ‘That’s insanely difficult. ‘People are a bit spoiled there because we’ve mostly made it early in recent years. If it works out this year, it will be a late decision. ‘It may take a while for us to catch up. But we know what we have to do.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
