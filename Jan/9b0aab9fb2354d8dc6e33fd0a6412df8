Like a puttanesca sauce but with sardines in place of the anchovies, this simple store-cupboard pasta recipe works well with any strongly flavoured tinned fish. Olives are considerably cheaper if you buy them in jars from the pickles and preserves section of the supermarket than from the fridge aisles â€“ and you get a free jar to boot! Serves 4 2 x 120g tins of sardines in oil 1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes 200ml vegetable, fish or chicken stock 2 tbsp pitted olives of any kind, finely chopped 1 tbsp lemon juice, or any kind of vinegar Salt and black pepper 280g spaghetti or other pasta 1. Tip the sardines into a saucepan, removing any large bones, and mash lightly with a fork. Add the tomatoes, stock and olives, then add the lemon juice or vinegar and plenty of black pepper, and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes; you may need to add a splash of water to stop it from drying out. When the sauce is cooked, remove it from the heat and leave to cool. 2. Cook the pasta in a pan of plenty of boiling salted water for 8 minutes, or according to the packet instructions. Drain and add to the sauce, and warm through to serve. 3. Want so save it for another day? Allow to cool completely, then seal in airtight bags or a lidded container. Will keep in the fridge for three days, or freezer for three months.
