Chelsea have submitted a €35 million (£30.8m) offer for Inter wing-back Denzel Dumfries, according to reports in Italy. After securing an £88.6m deal for Mykhailo Mudryk at the weekend, Chelsea are now focusing on bringing in a right-sided defender before the end of the January transfer window. Chelsea are currently without Reece James, who is sidelined with a recurring knee injury, and the club are keen to bring in competition for the 23-year-old. According to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Chelsea have now tabled a €35m (£30.8m) for Dumfries but Inter are looking for a significantly higher fee for the Netherlands international. The report claims that the Serie A club are demanding at least €55m (£48.4m) for the 26-year-old. Dumfries, who played for Netherlands at the World Cup in December, has also been linked with a move to Manchester United this month. Speaking last week, Dumfries’ agent refused to rule out the possibility of a move away from Inter before the end of the window. ‘He’s an inter player now, and then we’ll see what happens in the future,’ Rafaela Pimenta told RAI. Meanwhile, Mudryk has said that ‘hard work’ is the reason why he has ended up signing for Chelsea. ‘I’m very excited to be here and be part of the Chelsea project,’ the 22-year-old told Chelsea. ‘This is a big club and I’m happy to be here. I want to try and help the team win titles, I want to try and improve my game and to always do my best for Chelsea. ‘My career has always been focused on hard work and that is why I’m here. Hard work is a very strong thing for me and something I’ve always looked to do. ‘Every match in the Premier League is very difficult but I really can’t wait to get started here.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
