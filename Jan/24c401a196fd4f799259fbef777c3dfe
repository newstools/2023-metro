A schoolboy has been left ‘excited’ after finding the ‘world’s longest chip’ from an Asda packet of fries. Archie Davies was about to tuck into dinner with his family in Pontypool, Wales, when he made the discovery. The family decided to get a tape measure and found out it was a whopping nine inches in length. The 9-year-old had his picture taken with it to mark the occasion, and the chip appears to be longer than his head. He’s even decided to call the chip Geoff and is keen to show it off to the rest of the world. Archie’s mum, Laura Davies, said: ‘He was so excited when we found it. We have contacted the Guinness Book of Records to find out if it could actually be a world record as we think the last recorded longest chip was 8.8 inches and ours is nine. ‘Archie absolutely loves learning all about what the world records are. He has said absolutely no one is allowed to touch it for now and who knows if we ever will. ‘I’m surprised he didn’t try and take it into school today actually. He had a huge smile plastered on his face for a very long time after finding it. ‘We did the research last night not really thinking anything would come of it but then realised this chip may have actually broken a record. ‘Archie would love to be famous because of it I think.’ According to The Sun, Ethan Emms from Lincolnshire found the current record-holding longest chip which measured 8.6 inches – so just under Archie’s recent find. It seems Wales does have a reputation for extra long chips, with one being found in the Prince of Wales Wetherspoons in Cardiff in June 2022 that was 7.7 inches long. A spokesperson for Asda said: ‘What a find! Not only do we deliver big on value for our customers, but seemingly also on chips! We’ll keep our fingers crossed that this customer smashes the world record.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
