The body of a 5-year-old boy who was reported missing in September has been discovered in a river in Washington state. Lucian Munguia’s skeleton was found in the Yakima River on Thursday when county sheriff’s deputies responded to a report of remains around Yakima Valley Highway and Burke Road, according to police. The county coroner recovered the remains and examined the scene. Munguia was last seen at Sarg Hubbard Park on September 10. An autopsy was conducted on Friday and Munguia was identified based on comparing his dental records. DNA testing will be done for confirmation. ‘Based on the results of the autopsy, there is no indication of criminal acts that led to Lucian’s death,’ stated the police and sheriff’s office. Police Chief Matthew Murray said throughout the investigation that there was no evidence of foul play. The agencies thanked community members, professional organizations and volunteers who engaged in the nearly four-month search for Lucian. A $10,000 reward for information on the boy was offered. ‘Our thoughts and prayer are with the family and friends of Lucian,’ the agencies stated. Deputy Fire Chief DJ Goldsmith said the length of search efforts was not out of the ordinary considering the scale of the river. A team of divers with the FBI conducted a search of the pond in the park and bodies of water close by. ‘Even though we give 100% effort to locate things, including using infrared drones, there are so many tributaries and multiple places where things can get hung up,’ he said. Lucian’s family kept looking for him even after officials reduced their search efforts. A GoFundMe page for Lucian’s memorial service had raised more than $2,700 as of Monday afternoon. ‘Thank you all for the efforts given during his search and for the love you showered Lucian with,’ states the page. ‘He will forever and always be missed.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
