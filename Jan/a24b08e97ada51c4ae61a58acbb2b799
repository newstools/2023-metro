Casemiro ‘has to start’ against Crystal Palace tonight despite walking a disciplinary tightrope ahead of Manchester United’s trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday. That’s according to Ally McCoist, who says there’s ‘no debate’ whether the Brazilian should start against the Eagles. Casemiro will miss Sunday’s trip to the Emirates if he’s cautioned against Patrick Vieira’s side, as he’s one booking away from picking up his fifth yellow card of the season. Sunday’s game is United’s 19th of the season, when there’s an amnesty for previous cautions and players can afford to pick up ten bookings before they face a ban. Like Casemiro, Fred is one caution away from a ban but McCoist says the Brazilians must play against Palace regardless. ‘You’ve got to, absolutely you’ve got to,’ said McCoist, when asked if Casemiro should start tonight. ‘Yeah you’ve got to risk it, you’ve got to play him. You’ve got to play your best team right now and then deal with whatever happens. ‘The most important game is the next one and if they win tonight dear me, what a run they’re on since that defeat to City in the league. ‘I don’t think it’s up for debate. You’ve got to play him, assuming he’s fit obviously.’ United can move to within six points of leaders Arsenal before their trip to north London on Sunday if they beat Palace tonight. A win would take them above rivals City, who take on Tottenham at the Etihad on Thursday.
