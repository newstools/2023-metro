Jeremy Renner is heard crying out in pain in the 911 call a neighbour made after he was crushed by a 14,000-pound snowplough on New Year’s Day. His quick-thinking neighbour dialled 911 on discovering the Marvel star had been ‘crushed’ by his snowcat while he was trying to help a family member get their car out of heavy snow. The 52-year-old was airlifted to hospital from his Lake Tahoe mansion eventually, but sources claim he ‘almost died’ and could take ‘two years’ to recover. The neighbour, whose name has not been revealed, told the emergency services to come ‘immediately’ in the audio, obtained by TMZ, in which the Hurtlocker actor is heard moaning in agony. In what was an understandably frantic call, the unidentified neighbour repeatedly ordered Jeremy to stay ‘still’ while chatting to the operator, who asked for his address. ‘I told you!’ the neighbour is heard yelling, exasperated, to which the 911 respondent replied by asking him for his phone number in case they got disconnected. ‘Someone’s been run over by a snowcat, hurry’ the neighbour said. The operator repeated the question, and the neighbour began to respond but was cut off by the operator, who said: ‘Ok, tell me exactly what happened?’ ‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘Someone is in front of my house and he got run over by a snowcat. He’s been crushed.’ ‘Phone paramedics, ambulance,’ he continued, before the operator reassured him ‘everyone is on their way right now.’ A few terrifying moans from Jeremy can be heard through a short pause in the conversation before the distressed neighbour said: ‘Listen to me, you might want to get a lifeline out here immediately.’ Sensing the Hollywood star’s deteriorating condition, the female operator asked the neighbour to relay Jeremy’s injuries, to which he said there were ‘ribs issues’ and he was ‘crushed up on his right side’. The neighbour, a little calmer by this point, explained how the injuries covered his right chest, upper torso and his ribs, before he noted he also had a ‘head wound’. Responding to the man’s request for an estimated time of arrival, the operator said: ‘It’s hard to give an ETA just because of the snow on the mountain, I don’t know how quick they’re able to go.’ ‘His breaths are getting shorter, so please,’ said the neighbour, just before Jeremy almost fell into unconsciousness. ‘He’s drifting off,’ said the neighbour. ‘Stay awake.’ Weeks after the incident, the actor was still recovering at Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, due to the seriousness of his injuries. While there, the Bourne Legacy star shared a photo of his snow-covered home and captioned it, ‘Missing my happy place…’. The actor has undergone two surgeries – one to place metal pins around his legs and another operation on his chest. The actor is lucky to have survived the ordeal, as a source recently told RadarOnline: ‘It’s much worse than anyone knows. Jeremy is very aware of the fact that he almost died out there. ‘The right side of Jeremy’s chest was crushed, and his upper torso had collapsed. ‘He also had a bad head wound that was bleeding and a leg injury.’ On January 17 Jeremy returned to his beloved home, and raved on Twitter that he would get to watch the new episode of his current Paramount+ series Mayor Of Kingstown from the comfort of his own home. ‘Outside my brain fog in recovery, I was very excited to watch episode 201 with my family at home 🙏❤️🙏,’ the Avengers star wrote.
