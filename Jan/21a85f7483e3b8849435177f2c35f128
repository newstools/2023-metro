A shoplifter was filmed driving 120mph down the wrong way of a motorway in ‘eye-watering’ footage. Steven Baker, 29, dodged other motorists during a dramatic police pursuit on the A4042 in South Wales. He carried out the escape in a stolen Ford Fiesta. Baker was eventually caught after abandoning the car and fleeing on foot – when he broke both of his ankles after jumping over a wall. The 29-year-old, of Garndiffaith in Pontypool, pleaded guilty to burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving. Prosecutor Gareth James told Newport Crown Court: ‘It’s not an exaggeration to say it’s a miracle that no road user was either injured or killed by the defendant’s actions. ‘There was a flagrant and deliberate decision to disregard the rules of the road.’ Mr James said Baker had abandoned the car in Newport city centre before he attempted to flee on foot. He was spotted by a police helicopter and traced by officers. Judge Lucy Crowther told Baker: ‘It’s hard to see a worse example of dangerous driving. ‘You were driving at eye-wateringly terrifying speeds. It’s remarkable that no one was maimed or killed. ‘You put lives at risk.’ Baker was jailed for three years and nine months and banned from driving for a further three years. He was told he will have to sit an extended test before regaining his licence. William Bebb, defending, had said his client suffered mental health difficulties and depression.
