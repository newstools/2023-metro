A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a girl aged 15 was stabbed to death in a town centre. The girl and another boy, also 16, were found with stab wounds in Hexham, a market town in Northumberland, shortly after 5pm on Friday. They were both taken to hospital while their suspected assailant was arrested on suspicion of assault. It’s believed the three teenagers are known to each other. The girl succumbed to her injuries later that evening, detectives have now confirmed, prompting them to open a murder investigation. The male victim remains ‘seriously injured’. Chief Superintendent Sam Rennison of Northumbria Police said the girl’s family are ‘devastated beyond words’ and are being supported by specialists. She urged people not to speculate on the case, adding: ‘What might seem like an innocent post on social media to you, could in reality disrupt an ongoing investigation and cause further upset to the family of the victims. ‘We would ask that if you did see something or have information in relation to what has happened, and have not yet spoken to us, please come forward directly to officers.’ The murder suspect remains in custody.
