Summer feels like a long way off, but it’ll creep around before we know it. Perhaps you’re planning some exciting trips – looking ahead to sunnier and warmer days. And if you happen to be a French or German critizen you might want to make the most of a freebie scheme running this summer. The governments in France and Germany are handing out 60,000 free train tickets this summer to people under the age of 27. It has come about to mark the 60th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty – a treaty of friendship between France and Germany. The idea is that it will promote travel and cultural exchange between the two countries. If you’ve enjoyed interrailing before, this could be the perfect opportunity to travel by train again – all without it costing a penny. The scheme will offer one-way routes – similar to Interrail passes – and travellers can use their tickets to get around within the countries, too. Transport ministers Clément Beaune and Volker Wissing are behind the new initiative and more details on how you can get hold of these tickets are due to be announced in due course. This isn’t the only exciting European train news as of late. Last week, it was announced that a new ‘wine train’ will be launching, taking passengers directly from London to Bordeaux in a few hours.
