At least 40 people have been killed in a head-on crash between two buses in Senegal. Officials said a public bus was driving through the village of Gnivy, in the Kaffrine region, when one of its tyres blew out at 3.30am on Sunday. It caused it to veer into the path of another bus coming the other way. Shocking pictures show the mangled vehicles by the side of the road and the trail of debris. Dozens were killed and at least 78 people were injured, including some seriously. Senegal’s president Macky Sall said: ‘I am deeply saddened by the tragic road accident today in Gniby causing 40 deaths and many serious injuries. ‘I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to the injured.’ Mr Sall declared three days of mourning, starting on Monday, and promised to hold talks on road safety measures. Crashes happen regularly in the West African nation due to poor roads, bad cars and drivers not following the rules. In 2017, at least 25 people were killed when two buses crashed. Many were heading toward the central town of Touba for the annual Muslim pilgrimage. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
