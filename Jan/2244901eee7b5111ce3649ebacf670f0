A elderly man escaped certain death after getting trapped and almost falling onto the tracks. The pensioner was saved by a quick-thinking rail worker after he made an unwise dash to board a moving train at Purnia Junction station in the eastern Indian state of Bihar. Footage shows him rushing on to the platform and trying to jump on the carriage, which was already leaving the station. Fellow passengers looked on in shock as he lost his balance and was dragged along the platform surface, at risk of toppling under the train on to the tracks. Yet, just in time, the nearby rail worker hurtled over and hauled him to safety, before the train came to a stop. Government-owned Indian Railways, sharing the video online, tweeted in Hindi: ‘An alert RPF jawan saved a passenger who met with an accident while boarding a moving train in Bihar’s Purnia. Please do not attempt to board/deboard a moving train.’ There was plenty of praise for the rescuer in comments posted in response, with Manish N. Koparkar saying: ‘Salute to this RPF Jawan who saved a life. May God bless you.’ Ravi Kumar wrote: ‘Welldone!! you have done a great job. you have saved the precious life of a person. I was on board in this train.’ Another said, ‘He deserves an out of turn promotion’, while a separate commenter urged: ‘Frequently, we are seeing such incidents happening. There must be some sort of permanent solution that must be implemented.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
