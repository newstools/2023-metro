Jurgen Klopp delivered a frank assessment of Cody Gakpo’s Liverpool debut in the 2-2 FA Cup draw against Wolves on Saturday. The 23-year-old Netherlands international made his first appearance for the club since his £37m January arrival from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. Gakpo started on the left wing and played 84 minutes before being replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Klopp spoke to ITV following the match and admitted that the Reds ‘have to get him in better positions’ going forward. ‘He fitted into the game. It was not easy for a first step,’ Klopp said after Wolves were controversially denied a late winner in the third-round clash at Anfield. ‘We cannot expect it to be perfect, but he showed good signs. We have to get him in better positions but that will come no doubt.’ Gakpo, meanwhile, shared his thoughts on his own performance to the Liverpool website following the match. ‘Really great atmosphere,’ Gakpo said. ‘For my own game, I think I showed some good moments and some sloppy moments. ‘So, I can also still improve on those points and keep working and try to help the team as much as I can. ‘Of course you learn the most when you’re playing games, so I’m looking forward [to more]. ‘I think we played in phases really good football but in the end we didn’t score enough, so that’s a pity. ‘But I think we showed what we could do, but we can still improve on some points and let’s work on that. I think we showed real team spirit at moments, so that’s good. ‘I think we have to go there [Molineux] with great determination and just go for the win.’ Liverpool return to action on January 14 as they face Brighton at the Amex Stadium in the Premier League.
