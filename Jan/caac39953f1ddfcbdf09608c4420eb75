A famous DJ was found strangled to death and folded up in a suitcase left in a garbage container, it has been reported. Colombian authorities are investigating the killing Valentina Trespalacios, 23, after her body was discovered at a dumpster in the capital city of Bogota. Autopsy results showed deep grooves in her neck, which are likely to have been caused by strangulation. Her boyfriend, John Poulos, from Texas, has been missing since her body was found, the Sun reported. Police have now launched a manhunt for the 35-year-old, who has deleted all his social media accounts. The pair had been dating for eight months despite the English-Spanish language barrier and used translating apps to communicate. According to Colombian media, Valentina had gone to a party with Poulos, and investigators are trying to confirm if he has fled the country since. Her body was found by a member of the public over the weekend. Horrified about what was inside, they called the police. Forensics went on to find items belonging to the victim dumped alongside. These included a student ID card from Uninpahu University, where she was reportedly studying trade and global business technology. Police Lieutenant Colonel Camilo Torres told local media: ‘Work is being carried out with security cameras in the area to identify the alleged perpetrators.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
