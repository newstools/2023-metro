More than 100 Shih Tzu dogs are now up for adoption after being rescued from a squalid breeding house. The poor dogs were flea-infested and matted with faeces when officers found them in Torquay, Devon, following a noise complaint in October. Although 96 animals were rescued at the time, there are now around 150 of them, as so many were pregnant. The dogs were then split up and distributed to several RSPCA branches to be rehabilitated. They were absolutely terrified of people at first, but are now ready to be rehomed after the animal charity showed them ‘how kind humans can be’. RSPCA Cornwall has so far re-homed three dogs, but are on a mission to find forever homes for another ten Shih Tzus. New owners must be patient and willing to support the dogs through training and socialisation. RSPCA spokesperson Sammy Howard said: ‘They have had a difficult start to life and will not just slot into a home, and be grateful that someone took them on. ‘They will be terrified and may take months before they start trusting people, which is a hard sell when asking for someone to welcome a dog into their home. ‘We won’t give up hope that there are people out there for these dogs.’ Potential adopters can apply use the RSPCA website or call the centre on 01637 881455.
