Police are looking into the prime minister’s failure to wear a seat belt in the back of his luxury car. Rishi Sunak has apologised after his ‘error of judgment’ was spotted in an Instagram video promoting his levelling-up funding in Lancashire. In the video, police motorbikes can be seen escorting the car as the British leader addresses the camera. Fines of up to £500 can be issued when someone doesn’t wear a seatbelt when one is available. A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said tonight: ‘We are aware of the matter and we will be looking into it.’ In theory, Mr Sunak could become the second sitting prime minister found to have broken the law, less than a year after Boris Johnson became the first. While working as Chancellor, Mr Sunak was fined alongside Mr Johnson following the Partygate investigation. Commenting on the seatbelt incident, a Downing Street spokesman said earlier the PM ‘fully accepts this was a mistake and apologises’. ‘The Prime Minister believes everyone should wear a seatbelt’, he added. ‘It was an error of judgment, he removed it for a short period of time to film a clip, which you’ve seen, but he accepts that was a mistake.’ Mr Sunak was questioned on the incident as he walked off from a broadcast interview in Hartlepool, but declined to answer. There are a few exemptions for failing to wear a belt, including when a car is being used for police, fire and rescue services and for certified medical issues. But Number 10 does not believe there is an exception for travelling in a ministerial car. The government has contemplated toughening seatbelt rules to ensure drivers not wearing them could receive penalty points. Metro.co.uk has contacted Downing Street for further comment tonight.
