Rents reached record highs at the end of 2022 as the demand for rooms soared and landlords raised prices. New data from SpareRoom has revealed rents rose to an all-time high in the final quarter of 2022, with the average UK room rent increasing 13% year-on-year. The average rent was £731 in December, with rooms in Greater London surpassing £900 for the first time and reaching the average cost of £949. The demand for rooms also outweighed supply, as the number of properties available decreased over the year – but the amount of people searching for one reached a nine-year high. There were 245,351 renters looking for somewhere to live this year, but only 34,085 rooms available. This is only expected to get worse, with a recent poll suggesting that 2023 will see 41% of landlords either looking to reduce their portfolio or exit the rental market altogether. More than half of landlords surveyed also admitted to not having confidence in the rental market. But it is not all doom and gloom, as Scotland experienced a decrease in average rents. But this is largely due to rents being inflated at the end of 2021 in the Glasgow area due to the Cop26 summit. Matt Hutchinson, director at SpareRoom, said: ‘Although demand has eased since the record peaks we saw in August and September, the combined effect of low supply and the cos-of-living crisis means rents have continued to rise. ‘The last 12 months have seen rents across the UK hit record highs and, unless new supply comes into market over the coming months, it’s hard to see those rents come down meaningfully in 2023. ‘High rents not only make it difficult for tenants who need to move now, it also means that many stay put to avoid paying more rent. Unless people are able to move freely, the impact on the economy could be significant.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
