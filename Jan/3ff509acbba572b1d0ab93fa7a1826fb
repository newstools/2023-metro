A strike on the Elizabeth Line is underway after staff walked out in a dispute over pay. The line has closed parts of its service in the central section between Abbey Wood and Paddington. The Elizabeth line will operate as separate railways on the east and west of the line, but customers should be aware there may be alterations or cancellations to the service at short notice. In the east, between Shenfield and Liverpool Street mainline station, the line will operate a Saturday service of eight trains per hour, with three extra services per hour during the morning and evening peak. In the west, two trains will per hour will be running from Paddington to Reading, two trains per hour running from Paddington to Maidenhead, two trains per hour running from Paddington to Heathrow Terminal 4 and no services running to Heathrow Terminal 5. Howard Smith, TfL’s Director of the Elizabeth line, said: ‘Strikes are bad news for everyone, and we urge the TSSA and Prospect to continue to work with us to avoid industrial action. ‘These strikes will have a detrimental effect during a time where we are encouraging customers back on to trains into central London, in which the Elizabeth line has played a leading role.’ A good service is expected to resume at around 9am tomorrow (Friday, January 13). Full details are available on the TfL website. Some buses will also be impacted by Unite strike action on Abellio bus routes today. Full details of the effects of these strikes are available on TfL’s website, while the TfL Go app and Journey Planner will assist customers in planning their journeys around the action.
