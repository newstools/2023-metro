If you’ve got a generous budget of £1,200pcm to spend on rent, you may find yourself a little disappointed if you’re looking in West London. Flabbergasted may be more appropriate actually, because in Kensington that price will get you a room with an oven practically under your bed. The property is listed on OpenRent and is being marketed as a student rental for one tenant. The newly refurbished single self-contained studio flat is situated on Wrights Lane, just seconds away from High Street Kensington station. The £1,200pcm price is meant to include bills but only covers the central heating and hot water. The description reads an ‘open plan kitchenette’, however there is a giant double bed looming over the majority of the room, which many would have to duck to stand under. Not to mention the wooden support beam from the bed, which make it look almost impossible to stand in front of the hob, let alone open the oven door. The bed also blocks out a lot of the natural light coming from the singular window in the flat. Cooking dinner may have to involve some acrobatics, too. There’s no seating apart from a desk and office chair, despite claims it’s furnished, and we aren’t entirely sure where you would fit a decent sized armchair. The only plus to this studio flat is a decent sized ensuite shower and toilet, which looks clean and tiled and rather spacious. There isn’t much in the way of storage either, with two skinny full-length cupboards either side of the room. The ground floor flat was available from January 25. Is the location enough to tempt you?
