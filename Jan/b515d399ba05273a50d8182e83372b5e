Before the clocks struck midnight this New Year’s Eve, many of our schedules were already block-booked with weddings throughout 2023. At a certain age, it feels like everyone around you is getting hitched – and although the expense of attending can stack up, it does mean you may be asked to be in a wedding party or two. If you’ve been asked to be a bridesmaid this year, you’ll have hen parties and walking down the aisle on your mind. Up there at the top of the list of priorities, however, is likely to be the dress. We saw red come back into fashion in a big way in 2022, with Kate Middleton, Bella Hadid, and Megan Fox among the celebs donning the shade. As a result, we imagine wedding season will feature scarlets, crimsons, wines, bricks, and all manner of fiery hues in fashion and decor. With the pandemic changing the way couples tie the knot and the cost of living crisis prompting many of us to cut back, you’ll be pleased to know that there are tons of stunning bridesmaid dresses to suit your event. From indie designers to high street staples, you’re spoiled for choice between midi, maxi, and mini options, with brands like Club L London and Pretty Lavish creating pieces you’ll actually want to wear again. So whether you’re getting married and want to scope out red gowns for your bridal party, or you’ve been tasked with choosing your own complimentary dress, we’ve got you covered.
