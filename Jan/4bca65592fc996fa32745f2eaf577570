Arsenal chief executive Vinai Venkatesham says the club will back Mikel Arteta during the January transfer window but has refused to be drawn on the club’s pursuit of Mykhailo Mudryk. Arteta wants to bolster his Arsenal squad this month as he looks to guide Arsenal to their first league title since 2004. The Gunners have moved five points clear of defending champions Manchester City but Arteta believes reinforcements are needed to keep Pep Guardiola’s side at bay. Venkatesham says Arsenal have a ‘very clear plan’ in regards to the transfer window and has vowed to back Arteta if the right deal emerges. ‘We’ve got a very clear plan, headed up by Edu, in terms of what we want to do to strengthen the squad,’ Venkatesham told Sky Sports. ‘Every transfer window of course, we’re going to look to see what opportunities are out there. ‘If something makes sense from a technical perspective and a financial perspective, of course we’ll look at it but we’re happy with the squad that we’ve got. ‘We’ll have a look around like we do in every transfer window but we’ve got a long-term plan.’ Arsenal have made Shakhtar Donetsk and Ukraine international Mudryk their top target this month but face competition from Premier League rivals Chelsea. Pressed on whether Arsenal were any closer to signing Mudryk from Shakhtar, Venkatesham added: ‘You know the answer I’m going to give you. We’re not going to talk about specific players.’ Arsenal have won three of their four games since the Qatar World Cup to consolidate their lead at the top of the Premier League. Arteta’s side face north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday.
