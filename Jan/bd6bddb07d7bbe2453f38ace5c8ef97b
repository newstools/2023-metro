Police are looking for the driver of a car after a hit-and-run with pedestrians left six injured. A car crashed into the people just before 7.13pm yesterday in Green Lanes, near to the junction with Salisbury Road in Harringay. Video footage shows a man shouting ‘oh my God, all these people’ while filming what appears to be a 4×4 speeding away from the scene. The camera then pans round to show several people lying on the floor and crying. Police, paramedics and the London Fire Brigade attended the scene. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: ‘Six pedestrians were injured. Four people were taken to hospital and two people were treated at the scene. ‘None of the pedestrians are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries. ‘The car failed to stop at the scene and officers are working to trace the driver. ‘Emergency services remain at the scene and road closures are in place.’ They added it is being treated as a road traffic collision and further enquiries are taking place to work out exactly what happened. A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: ‘We sent a number of resources to the scene including five ambulance crews, two medics in response cars, two team leaders, an incident response officer and London’s air ambulance. ‘We treated six people at the scene and took four to hospital while two declined further treatment.’ Anyone with information that could help is asked to call the police on 101, quoting CAD 5189/22Jan.
