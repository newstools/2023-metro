Five people were found dead in a house after one of them apparently killed the others and then themselves, police have said. Officers found the bodies of two adults and three children in the home in North Carolina on Saturday. All five people were found dead at the scene in the north-east of High Point city centre. Authorities did not say how they died but the killings are being investigated as a ‘murder-suicide’. There is no ongoing threat to the community, investigators said. Officers were called to the scene after a man and woman ran from the house screaming, and officers found the pair asking for help when they arrived. Police captain Matt Truitt told the Greensboro News And Record the two who fled the home were unhurt. Officers forced entry into the house and found the victims, according to the press release. The victims’ ages or identities have not been released. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
