Arsenal have submitted a third offer to sign Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk, according to reports. The Gunners have made the 21-year-old winger their priority target for the January transfer window but have yet to reach an agreement with Shakhtar. Arsenal have already seen two offers for Mudryk rejected by Shakhtar, who are holding out for a fee in the region of £85 million. But according to The Times, Arsenal have now tabled a third bid which is worth £62m before add-ons, which take the deal closer to £70m. Meanwhile, SportArena report that Arsenal and Shakhtar have held extensive talks over the bonus structure of the deal, with the Ukrainian side demanding add-ons be worth 20 per cent of the total fee. It’s understood that Mudryk has already agreed personal terms with Arsenal and is keen to join Mikel Arteta’s side this month. The Ukraine international has made several posts on Instagram over the last few weeks to make it clear to his followers that he is keeping tabs on Arsenal’s progress. On Thursday, Mudryk uploaded a picture to Instagram which features a video of him wearing Arsenal’s kit during a photoshoot. Chelsea have also held initial talks to sign Mudryk ahead of Arsenal this month. However, it’s understood that Chelsea’s approach has been ‘exploratory’ and that they have no intention of meeting Shakhtar’s £85m asking price. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
