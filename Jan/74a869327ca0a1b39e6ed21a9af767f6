Chelsea fans sang Thomas Tuchel’s name as they crashed out of the FA Cup following a 4-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday. Graham Potter will now come under increased pressure after his side’s woeful performance at the Etihad Stadium in which they registered just one shot on target. A double from Riyad Mahrez, plus goals from Julian Alvarez and Phil Foden, sealed a comfortable win for Pep Guardiola’s side, who will now play either Arsenal or Oxford United in the FA Cup fourth round. For Chelsea, the result means they have lost six out of their last 10 games in all competitions under Potter. And to make matters worse for Potter, Chelsea’s supporters paid a special tribute to Tuchel, who was sacked in September, as they chanted his name at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday evening. Speaking after Chelsea’s defeat, Alan Shearer slammed their performance against City. ‘He [Potter] made a couple of changes at half time which was no surprise,’ Shearer told the BBC. ‘They had a little bit more energy second half, tried to put a couple of tackles in which they didn’t do at all first half, nowhere near good enough. ‘It’s a big week coming up, they’ve got Fulham and Palace in their next two league games, they have to show more than they showed today. ‘We’ve said it, we know they’ve got injuries, with so many of them it’s tough for them, but that doesn’t stop the players out on the pitch putting a shift in, having an attitude, showing they belong in a Chelsea shirt. The next two games are so important for them.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
