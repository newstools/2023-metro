Prince Harry seems to have become the stern of the joke since his biography hit the bookstores. Breaking records globally, ‘Spare’ has become the fastest-selling nonfiction book in the UK since records began, but it has exposed the Duke of Sussex to a lot of ridicule. This is at least what pranksters did after they spotted the name of a famous ferry in Cornwall. A sign leading drivers to the King Harry Ferry, near Philleigh, was tweaked in light of the recent book. The stunt saw the word ‘King’ crossed out and the word ‘Spare’ scribbled with a black marker above instead. The word is a reference to the expression ‘heir and spare’. It is typically made in reference to members of the monarchy or nobility, who are said to need two children. One is to succeed to a title and the other to guarantee the family line continues should anything happen to the first child. Clare Freeth, who runs Penhallow Farm Holidays nearby, noticed the change and took a picture, sharing it on social media. She wrote: ‘They have re-named our ferry!’ Established in 1888, the ferry connects St Mawes and the Roseland Peninsula with Feock, Truro and Falmouth. It carries at least 300,000 vehicles every single year, so unless the sign gets fixes, a lot of people are likely to have a good giggle.
