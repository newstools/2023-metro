You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink, the old proverb goes. That’s certainly the case when the horse in question is a statue. Firefighters in North Yorkshire enjoyed an equine-based error when they were called out to a flood in North Road, Ripon in the morning on January 11. A concerned member of the public had spotted a horse stranded in the high water. They’d raised the alarm with a fire officer scrambling to the scene. He soon worked out that the horse in question was a statue – made to commemorate the First World War. The fire service was then stood down. The North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service issued a statement on the unusual call-out which said: ‘An officer attended a report of a horse seen in flood water. ‘This was found to be a false alarm, the horse seen was actually a statue that had been surrounded by flood water. ‘No action was required by the fire service.’ A similar misidentified animal caused short-lived chaos in Oldham, Manchester last year. A concerned resident said they spotted a ‘tiger’ in the garden of a home in the town. Officers rushed to the scene to find very terrifyingly – it was just a stuffed animal. Over in Kenya, a farm worker saw a lion’s ‘face’ in some bushes and feared the big cat was ready to pounce. Three armed wildlife officers rushed to the village of Kinyana to trap the creature. They found nothing but a carrier bag, which featured a picture of a lion’s face, and discovered it had been placed in the bushes by a nearby homeowner. She had avocado tree seedlings in the bag, and hadn’t wanted them to dry out in the sun, so placed them among the thick hedge branches.
