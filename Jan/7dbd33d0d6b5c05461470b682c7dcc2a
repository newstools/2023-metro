NHS waiting lists are growing, ambulances are queuing outside hospitals and staff are exhausted – there has never been a worse time to get sick in Britain. This week brings further industrial action to the already crippled health service. Thousands of nurses – among other public sector workers – are heading to the picket lines today. Services from education to health to transport are being hit by walkouts this month and beyond. This is all happening as the government is gearing up its anti-strike legislation. Metro.co.uk has been keeping readers up to date with the latest developments around the talks over pay, pensions and job security, which have so far failed. So, who is on strike today? Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are heading to the picket lines today for their third day of action. Staff at 55 NHS trusts in England are walking out today, including in the capital where there is the worst shortage of nurses in the UK. It comes just a day after the union announced an escalation of industrial action. Nurses will also strike on February 6 and 7, with more trusts taking part than in December. Children continue to miss out on more lessons in Scotland today as teachers take further strike action. They will be on the picket lines for the next two weeks in a dispute over declining pay. The planned industrial action b the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) will hit certain councils on different days, with Orkney and Fife affected today. Despite the union recently negotiating with the government, an agreement has not yet been reached and an offer of a 5% rise was turned down. Any new offer would need to be agreed by all 32 council leaders but they are not due to meet until towards the end of January. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
