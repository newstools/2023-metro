Benfica have left Enzo Fernandez out of their squad for tonight’s game against Arouca after the Argentine asked the club to accept Chelsea’s £105m bid. A deal for the Argentina star looked dead in the water earlier this month after Chelsea refused to activate his release clause. The Blues instead wanted to structure an agreement that would see them pay a fee for the World Cup winner over several years. However, Chelsea have revived their pursuit in recent days and Fernandez fears it could be his last chance to complete a move to Stamford Bridge. Given the club’s spending, the Blues could conceviably move on to other targets this summer if they don’t land Fernandez now and the Argentine has asked Benfica to accept Chelsea’s bid. According to Duncan Castles, the club have therefore left him out of tonight’s squad to face Arouca as they want to resolve his future one way or another. Chelsea have agreed to sell Jorginho to Arsenal in a £12m deal, though the Italian’s transfer is not believed to be dependent on landing Fernandez. Conor Gallagher is not keen on a move to Everton, despite the Toffees being willing to pay around £45m for the midfielder. Chelsea have already spent £200m this January, having spent nearly £300m last summer. Should Fernandez arrive for £105m, he would become the most expensive footballer in British history.
