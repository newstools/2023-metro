Announcing that their brood is about to grow, the star shared an adorable video in which Kate unbuttons her coat to reveal a glimpse of her baby bump underneath a midi dress.

They were met with a wealth of love and congratulatory messages, with fans and famous friends keen to share their happiness. Molly-Mae Hague commented: ‘Congratulations Kate ✨’ ‘Yay congratulations lovely 💕’, added Lottie Tomlinson. ‘Omg babe! Congratulations 😍’, commented Vicky Pattison. Their joyous news follows a devastating time for the pair, after Kate suffered a miscarriage. Kate revealed in July last she had lost her pregnancy at 12 weeks, saying she was ‘absolutely devastated.’ Writing on Instagram at the time, Kate explained: ‘The last time I was in this hospital I was having Cree, but this time it was because our baby had no heartbeat in our 12 week scan and I had to have surgery. ‘We were so excited & planning a space for our new baby in our family, we just couldn’t wait to share our news with you all, but unfortunately sometimes life just doesn’t go as we plan.’ The ‘heartbroken’ star took some time off from social media to deal with the loss, but later made a return where she thanked fans for their support. Former Towie star Kate said she was ‘so grateful for all of your messages,’ adding she was ‘feeling good mentally.’ ‘Thank you for continually checking in.’ Got a story?
