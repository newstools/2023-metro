A bird charity cocked things up after being banned from Twitter for tweeting too many pictures of woodcocks. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) was preparing for a nationwide survey of the threatened wader bird before it was barred from the platform. The group has been unable to get in touch with anyone from Twitter after an age verification prompt was sent by the platform on January 20. They partnered with BBC’s Winter Watch show which aired last week and barred the charity from ‘a crucial engagement opportunity’ with it’s 116,000 Twitter followers. Tom Stewart, Media Manager at BTO, said: ‘Twitter is our most important social media channel for engaging with our supporters ‘We don’t know exactly what happened but we did do a lot of Tweets about a bird called a woodcock. ‘After the age verification prompt, we were locked out for eight days and it was impossible to get hold of anyone from Twitter. ‘Even from their press office. Half the people on LinkedIn who state they’re employees for Twitter don’t work there anymore. ‘Maybe the Twitter algorithm interprets the word ‘woodcock’ differently. But we’re a big charity and rely on Twitter to raise awareness and speak with people.’ The woodcock is on the red list in the UK for its threatened status. The charity’s Twitter access returned on January 29 with no explanation from the social media platform. Twitter has been contacted for comment.
