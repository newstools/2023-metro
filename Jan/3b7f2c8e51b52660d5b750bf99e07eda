Kim Jong Un vowed to expand North Korea’s nuclear arsenal ‘exponentially’ to counter US-led threats. At a meeting of the Workers’ Party, the supreme leader called for developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and a larger nuclear capability to counter threats from the US and South Korea, state media said on Sunday. The politician accused the two countries of trying to ‘isolate and stifle’ Pyongyang with US nuclear strike assets constantly deployed in South Korea, According to the official Korean Central News Agency, he called it ‘unprecedented in human history’. As a result, the leader announced plans to develop another ICBM system ‘whose main mission is quick nuclear counter-strike’. A statement read: ‘The prevailing situation calls for making redoubled efforts to overwhelmingly beef up the military muscle… in response to the worrying military moves by the U.S. and other hostile forces. Mr Kim described South Korea as ‘our undoubted enemy’, adding that it is ‘hell-bent on imprudent and dangerous arms build-up’. ‘It highlights the importance and necessity of a mass-producing of tactical nuclear weapons and calls for an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal,’ he stressed. ‘We have declared our resolute will to respond with nuke for nuke and an all-out confrontation for an all-out confrontation.’ His alarming statement comes just hours after the country fired a ballistic missile over the sea to the east of the Korean Peninsula in the early hours of New Year’s Day. South Korea’s president Yoon Suk-yeol called for ‘solid mental readiness and practical training’ to ensure any provocations from the North will be met with retaliation.
