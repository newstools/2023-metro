Chelsea are set to kickstart their January spending with the arrival of Monaco ace Benoit Badiashile after agreeing a £34million deal to sign the defender. The Blues spent £300m last summer under Thomas Tuchel but Graham Potter has been promised more funds this month. Despite the arrivals of Wesley Fofana and Kalidou Koulibaly, Potter feels his defence is in need of reinforcement. Badiashile, 21, had been earmarked by Manchester United before the signing of Lisandro Martinez and the defender is widely regarded as one of the finest young talents in Europe. The defender already has two caps for France to his name and is a regular in Monaco’s first team, having made 135 appearances for the Ligue 1 giants. And the Athletic say Chelsea have struck a deal to sign the Frenchman for around £34m. It comes as Chelsea look to strike a deal for Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez. The Benfica ace has a £106m release clause in his contract but Chelsea are happy to bid above that price if it means rearranging the financing of the deal so they don’t have to pay the entire fee upfront. Chelsea languish in 9th place in the Premier League table, trailing fourth placed Manchester United by eight points. The Blues have won just one of their last six matches in the Premier League but Potter hopes new arrivals this month will help turn things around.
