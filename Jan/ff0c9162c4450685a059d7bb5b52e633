If you haven’t watched The White Lotus yet, where have you been? The series is all anyone has been speaking about for the past month or so – but don’t worry we won’t give away any spoilers. Whether you’re familiar with the show or not, you can now experience the Sicillian setting for yourself – as the stunning Italian villa where Harper and Daphne stay for one evening is available to rent on Airbnb. Located in Palermo, Sicily, the estate dates back to the 1500s and features 20-acres of garden and four bedrooms – each with an ensuite bathroom. The Renaissance villa, with space for eight people, has luxury and grandeur at every turn with high ceilings, tall windows, polished stone floors and Italian art. Shedding light on the beautiful decor, the Airbnb listing reads: ‘Details like gold-edged portraits, carved wooden wardrobes, and marble bathroom tiles make a statement in each suite.’ It also boasts views of the gorgeous Italian countryside and has a private pool, billiards room, music room and bar. Die-hard fans will recognise the pool from the series – where Harper and Daphne have a deep conversation while taking dip. However, this dreamy set-up will cost you. In fact, those looking to stay will have to fork out £5,000 per night. If you decide to leave the villa, it’s a short trip to the center of Palermo – or you can head to Monreale for a walk by the port, a visit to the cathedral, or a stop at a family-friendly waterpark.
