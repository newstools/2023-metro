A three-year-old girl has died after being found in a washing machine in France. Authorities in Paris are investigating with a special unit tasked to the incident. According to the Le Parisien newspaper, the girl was found alive in the washing machine last night. She was then rushed to hospital where she died in emergency care an hour later. Her father and another family member reportedly discovered her in the machine during dinner. The household appliance hadn’t been turned on but had doors that shut automatically, Le Parisien reports. Prosecutors say the girl had been at home in her family’s apartment in Paris’s 20th arrondissement – an area to the west of the city centre. A special unit for the protection of minors is leading the investigation. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
