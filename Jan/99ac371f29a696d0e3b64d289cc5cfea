Apple is set to increase the cost of replacing batteries in older iPhone models from 1st of March this year. The tech giant will charge an extra $20 in the US for battery replacements on iPhone 13, 12, 11 and X models. Customers in the US using a notched iPhone (iPhone X through iPhone 13) will see the price jump from $69 to $89. Meanwhile, anyone still rocking an iPhone SE or iPhone 8 (basically, an iPhone with the home button) will see battery replacement service climb from $49 to $69. This doesn’t affect customers on the current flagship iPhone 14 series, because the cost for replacing their batteries is already a hefty $99. Therefore, if you’re reading this in the US and have an older iPhone it may be a good idea to book in for a battery replacement before 1st March. It’s not clear if similar price rises will take place in the UK, but we wouldn’t bet against it. Apple hasn’t clarified the reason for the price hike, but has updated the pricing on the iPhone battery service page on its website. A few years ago Apple did drop the pricing for replacing batteries after admitting it deliberately throttled performance on older phones. If you want to get your iPhone’s battery swapped, it can be done either at Apple stores at the Genius Bar or online using a mail-in service.
