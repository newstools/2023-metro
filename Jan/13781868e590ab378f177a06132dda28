As the weather takes a freezing turn, you might be daydreaming about your next getaway. So if you need some inspiration, TripAdvisor have just announced the winners of their Travellers’ Choice Awards for 2023. And once again, Dubai has taken the top spot in their ‘popular destinations’ category for the second year in row. The Emirate – beloved by celebrities and influencers – is famed for it’s opulence, long brunches and year-round sunshine. But dig a little deeper and you’ll find a city rich in tradition and culture. TripAdvisor said: ‘A favourite with celebs and influencers, the “City of Gold” continues to attract tourists from all over the world seeking out their very own slice of luxury.’ London also retained it’s title as the most popular European destination, with TripAdvisor describing the city as having ‘many worlds in one.’ But the city has slipped down into third place in the global rankings, behind Bali, Indonesia, which secured the silver medal as the second most popular destination. The winners for the 2023 awards were selected by ‘real travellers’ according to TripAdvisor. The lists are compiled based on the quality and quantity of reviews and ratings from travellers on TripAdvisor for a variety of subcategories including accommodations, restaurants, and things to do in destinations worldwide. The awards take into accounts reviews over the 12 months between November 2021 and October 2022. Other popular destinations that made it into the European top 10 include Rome (second) and Paris (third). Globally, European cities also did well, with Lisbon, Madeira and Crete all making it into the top 25. TripAdvisor also released other award categories: trending destinations, best food destinations, best nature destinations, best places for cultures, and best places to ski. Cuba won the top spot in the trending destinations category, with TripAdvisor describing it’s capital, Havana as ‘a balance of old-world architecture and contemporary nightlife.’ Meanwhile Hoi An, Vietnam came second, and Mauritius secured third place. For food, it’ll come as no surprise to pizza, pasta and gelato lovers that TripAdvisor says you’ll need to head over to Rome, to enjoy world-class cuisine. And for those who go on holiday to be at one with nature, Mauritius bagged the top spot here, with TripAdvisor citing it’s great deep-sea fishing.
