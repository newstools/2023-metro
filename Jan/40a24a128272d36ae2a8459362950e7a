Prince Harry has revealed he would shop in TK Maxx for ‘everyday casual clothes’, despite getting an official clothing allowance from his dad. The Duke of Sussex said he was ‘particularly fond’ of the discount store’s annual sale, where he could buy designer items at cheaper prices. Writing in his autobiography Spare, Harry shared his ‘system’ for snagging bargains and optimising his time spent shopping. ‘Each year I received from Pa an official clothing allowance, but that was strictly for formal wear. Suits and ties, ceremonial outfits,’ he wrote. ‘For my everyday casual clothes I’d go to TK Maxx, the discount store. ‘I was particularly fond of their once-a-year sale, when they’d be flush with items from Gap or J Crew, items that had just gone out of season or were slightly damaged.’ Describing his shopping operation, he continued: ‘If you timed it just right, got there on the first day of the sale, you could snag the same clothes that others were paying top prices for down the high street! ‘With two hundred quid you could look like a fashion plate.’ Harry added that he would aim to get to the shop 15 minutes before closing time and work his way ‘systematically’ down the racks. He said he never ‘dawdled over colour or style’ and ‘certainly never went near a changing room’. ‘At closing time we would run out with two giant shopping bags, feeling triumphant,’ he wrote. ‘Now the papers wouldn’t call me a slob. At least for a little while.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
