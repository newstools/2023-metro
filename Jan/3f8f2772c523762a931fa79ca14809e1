Waiting on hold seemingly forever with your bank’s customer service is a special kind of hell but this AI tool will do it for you. DoNotPay, the technology company behind the world’s first ‘robot lawyer’ has come up with a new tool that can speak to banks’ customer support using an AI-generated version of your voice. On Wednesday, the company’s founder and CEO, Joshua Browder, posted a demo video on Twitter where he shows an AI deepfake clone of his voice call up Well Fargo and successfully overturn wire fees. ‘This is the perfect use case for AI. Nobody has time to argue on the phone about $12!,’ said Browder in the post. ‘We plan on making the tool publicly available with a range of generic custom voices, but to have the user’s own voice it will be a premium option,’ Browder told Motherboard. Bowder added that the application can be applied to ‘endless legal negotiations, like phoning up Southwest to get a refund’. The tool was built using a combination of Resemble.ai, a site that lets users create their own AI voices, GPT-J, an open source casual language model, and Do Not Pay’s own AI models for the script. However, judging by the video, it clearly sounds like a robot is on the phone. Getting it to sound natural might take more work but Do Not Pay plans to make the tool available to customers. Browder, a Stanford University-educated computer scientist, launched DoNotPay in 2015 as a chatbot that provides legal advice to consumers dealing with late fees or fines. The company wants to help people ‘fight corporations, beat bureaucracy and sue anyone at the press of a button’. His ultimate goal is to have his app replace lawyers altogether in order to save defendants money. Last month, his company’s chatbot successfully negotiated with internet provider Comcast’s representatives to save $120 a year on an employee’s Internet bill.
