A Pontins holiday resort is being shut down to house nuclear power plant workers for the next three years. The Brean Sands resort in Somerset will undergo a major refurbishment before letting in workers from Hinkley Point C. It currently is made up of 600 chalets, a leisure complex,  swimming pool, shop, and play areas. By the end of 2023 up to 900 workers will be housed in the once-popular family resort, Somerset Live reports. Following the application from EDF Energy to Sedgemoor District Council to change the use of the camp, the chalets will be upgraded, and wifi will be installed. Some members of staff have already moved in, but camp visitors will be able to enjoy the upgrades when it re-opens in three years. An EDF spokesperson: ‘EDF has taken over the site for three years in order to house 900 Hinkley Point workers and undertake a multi-million-pound refit of the park to ensure the accommodation is of a high standard for workers. ‘After three years, the park will revert back to tourism use. ‘The phased approach to the refurbishment is going well and we expect to complete later this year. ‘There are around 50 Hinkley Point C workers staying at the site currently and we expect that to rise to 900 by the end of the year. We expect to finish the refurb later this year.’ The power plant is expected to start operation in June 2027 – a year later than originally planned.
