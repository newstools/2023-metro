On tonight’s episode of Love Island, the Islanders will have to air their dirty laundry as a part of the first challenge of the series. The boys are teaming up against the girls to guess which secrets belong to which contestant. They’ll learn, among other things, that one says her favourite sex position is: ‘backshots’? For those not in the know, here’s exactly what that means… Warning: The following is, as you might imagine, not safe for work… As with a lot of sex positions, the definition can be a bit subjective. According to Urban Dictionary, a backshot is either sex from behind while the person being penetrated is on their knees (aka, doggy), or essentially a twist on doggy style. The twist still involves one sexual partner penetrating the other from behind, with the penetrated one on all fours. It doesn’t matter whether this is anal or vaginal, but it does matter that the penetrator is able to ejaculate, or is equipped with a toy that can simulate it. That’s key to the whole backshot part, because when it’s time to climax, the penetrator ejaculates on the back of the penetratee. You can obviously achieve this through unprotected sex, but you can do it if you wear a condom for the penetration part too. Just pull out, remove the condom, and masturbate until completion. Love Island is always, ahem, educational, when it comes to sex positions. In the last season, we heard all about the broken eagle and Viennese oyster. Who knows what else we’ll be learning this season… Love Island airs tonight at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. Do you have a story to share?
