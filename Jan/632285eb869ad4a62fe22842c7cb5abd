Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was compared to a Cbeebies presenter and Will from the Inbetweeners as he gave his first speech of 2023. As he set out his five ‘promises’ to the nation for the next 12 months viewers seemed to care less about what he was saying and more about his delivery. His soft tone, and condescending voice led those watching to think he was speaking to a room of schoolchildren. Despite outlining pledges to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists, and stop the boats he seemingly came across like he was reading a bed time story. Sunak said he is promising to ‘build a better future’ and focused on the ‘people’s priorities’ in his latest speech. But Twitter and the internet were having none of it. Daryl Cox said: ‘Rishi Sunak sounds like he’s talking to a room of children. It’s hard to take him seriously at all.’ Ewan Huzami said: ‘Listening to Rishi Sunak, I can’t help noticing how much he sounds like Will from The Inbetweeners.’ While another Twitter user said: ‘Sounds like Rishi Sunak is auditioning for a Cbeebies bedtime story’ Another said: ‘RIshi Sunak currently delivering a speech about positive thinking with the tonality of a children’s TV presenter talking about yoghurt.’ LBC presenter Shelagh Fogarty said he was ‘dull and boring’ and that it could have been condensed into 5-10 minutes. She said: ‘He does have the tendency to sound like a head boy in tone, and at worst a Cbeebies bedtime story reader’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
