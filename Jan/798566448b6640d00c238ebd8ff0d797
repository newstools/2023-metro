King Charles looked decidedly upbeat during his first public engagement since the release of Prince Harry’s memoir Spare. William and Kate also appeared relaxed and full of smiles today as they appeared in public together. The Prince and Princess of Wales visited the new Royal Liverpool University Hospital, and gave thanks to people working across Merseyside’s healthcare and mental health services. Meanwhile, Charles, who came dressed in a very fetching kilt, was greeted by Lord Lieutenant Sandy Manson at the Aboyne and Mid-Deeside Community Shed in Aberdeenshire. He was given a tour and watched craft skills in action, including a display of wood and stone carving. The Royal Family has been embroiled in a media frenzy following the release of Spare, which has become the fastest selling non-fiction book in history since it hit the shelves. According to its publisher Penguin Random House, the English language edition sold more than 1,430,000 copies across the UK, US and Canada on Tuesday. Harry’s revelations have made headlines for days, from his account of being attacked by his brother, to killing 25 people in Afghanistan, and taking illegal drugs. Speaking about the record sales, publisher Gina Centrello said: ‘While many books by public figures can be fairly categorized as “celebrity memoir,” Spare is not that. ‘Vulnerable and heartfelt, brave and intimate, Spare is the story of someone we may have thought we already knew, but now we can truly come to understand Prince Harry through his own words. ‘Looking at these extraordinary first day sales, readers clearly agree, Spare is a book that demands to be read, and it is a book we are proud to publish.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
