Lisa Marie Presley, US singer and only child of Elvis Presley, has died at the age of 54, her mother has said. The announcement came just hours after Priscilla Presley had confirmed that Lisa Marie Presley was rushed to hospital late on Thursday. ‘It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us,’ Priscilla Presley said in a statement. ‘She was the most passionate, strong and loving woman I have ever known.’ Earlier today Priscilla asked fans to keep her daughter Lisa Marie in their prayers, after she was rushed to hospital. She was said to have been taken away in ambulance after paramedics performed CPR on Thursday at her home in Calabasas. Sources added to TMZ that paramedics were ‘able to regain a pulse before she was transported’. Priscilla, who was married to Elvis until 1973, has since issued a statement asking for privacy. Lisa Marie and Priscilla both attended the Golden Globes on Tuesday in Beverly Hills, supporting Austin Butler who won an award for his portrayal of the King of Rock n Roll in biopic Elvis. Priscilla met Elvis when she was just 14 and he was 25 in 1959 at a party in Germany, with the then young girl permanently moving in with the star four years later. They married in 1967, welcoming Lisa Marie just nine months later. However, they divorced in 1972, although they remained close until his death in 1977.
