Lidl has a number of offers in the middle aisle every week – called the Middle of Lidl. From BBQs to fitness gear, and scuba-diving equipment to weighted blankets – there are always some great deals to be found. But what does the legendary middle aisle have in store of Lidl shoppers this week? Here are our top picks. This week, Lidl’s offering is all about sprucing up your home. From cosy loungewear to bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom essentials, your space will be refreshed for the New Year after a trip to the supermarket. If the much-loved Oodie is out of your price range, this version from Lidl is a great budget alternative. Lined with teddy fleece and featuring a roomy middle pocket, it’s perfect for staying cosy while keeping the heating down. Buy for £12.99 in Lidl stores from today. Many people are using electric blankets to stay toasty at night, but this could be an even more affordable way to snuggle up. The self-heating topper uses a heat reflecting layer combined with a deeply filled quilted top layer to add up to 7.5 tog of extra warmth to your bed. Buy from £27.99 (for the single size) in Lidl stores from today. You’ll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on this heated clothes airer, which sold out in minutes last time it was available. It offers the best of both worlds, using less energy than a tumble dryer and drying laundry quicker than a standard airer. Buy for £49.99 in Lidl stores from today. One thing you learn as you grow up and become independent is how expensive bins are – but this one has all the mod cons without the crazy price tag. A retainer ring keeps your bin bag in position, while lid opens automatically thanks to the integrated motion sensor. Buy for £39.99 in Lidl stores from Sunday January 15.
