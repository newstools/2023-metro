A young boy in Australia had a lucky escape after a shark lunged for his chest while he was out on a fishing trip. Manni Alam had just caught a coral trout while swimming in the waters around Lady Musgrave Island on the Great Barrier Reef. Family friend Moe Alsayed, who was leading the trip alongside Manni’s dad Radwan, asked the eight-year-old to show off the catch while he filmed for a TikTok. But as Manni slapped the fish down on the deck of the boat, a shark burst out of the water under his arm and clamped its jaws around his chest. The attack is only shown for a split second on the video, as Moe stopped filming to try and help. Manni later said the shark didn’t hang on for very long, and he was just left with a small scratch. He told Australia’s 9News: ‘I caught this huge trout, and I just wanted to show it on TikTok. ‘I went in the water, I was holding the trout, then a huge shark attacked me for the fish.’ He added: ‘It just felt like a little bite – it hurt a bit on the chest, but that’s it.’ Radwan said: ‘Anyone that’s dived, knows that it’s a very common thing when you’re diving. ‘Sharks are a very, very common occurrence.’ An investigation for the Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File last year found that there were 12 unprovoked shark bites reported in Australia in 2021, of which three were fatal. Most of those incidents were in New South Wales, where a scuba diver filmed a chillingly close encounter last month. But none of it will stop Manni from jumping back into the beautiful sea off eastern Australia in the future. He told the news channel: ‘I’m going back in.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
