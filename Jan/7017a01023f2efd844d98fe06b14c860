A convicted Mafia boss responsible for dozens of murders has finally been arrested after 30 years on the run. Matteo Messina Denaro was a young man when he went into hiding, but soon became Italy’s most-wanted man. He had a power base in the port city of Trapani, in western Sicily, and was considered the top Cosa Nostra boss even while a fugitive. Now aged 60, Messina Denaro was captured at a private clinic in Palermo, where he was receiving treatment for an undisclosed medical condition. Dramatic images show armed paramilitary police taking him to a secret location immediately after his arrest. The aging mobster was the last of three long-time fugitive Mafia bosses who eluded capture for decades. But he now faces the rest of his life in prison after being tried in absentia and convicted of dozens of murders. Some of the grisly crimes he was found guilty of include two bombings that killed anti-Mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, in 1992. He was also convicted in the murder of a Mafia informant’s young son, who was strangled and dissolved in a vat of acid. Today’s arrest came almost exactly 30 years after the capture of ‘boss of bosses’ Salvatore ‘Toto’ Riina, who spent 23 years on the run.
