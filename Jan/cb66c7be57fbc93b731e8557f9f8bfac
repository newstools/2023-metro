Paris Hilton is stepping into 2023 as a new mum having welcomed her first child via surrogate. The 41-year-old US socialite and businesswoman announced the exciting news that she and her husband Carter Reum, also 41, have become parents on Tuesday night. ‘It’s always been my dream to be a mother and I’m so happy that Carter and I found each other,’ she enthused. Speaking to People, Paris added: ‘We are so excited to start our family together and our hearts are exploding with love for our baby boy.’ Sharing an adorable picture of a baby gripping a thumb on Instagram, Paris captioned the post: ‘You are already loved beyond words.’ Paris was immediately met with an outpouring of love from her celebrity friends, with Kim Kardashian commenting: ‘So happy for you guys!!! 🤍’ Demi Lovato said: ‘Congratulations sis!!!!’ ‘Love you’, Ashley Benson added, while Chrissy Teigen penned: ‘A BABY!!!!! Congratulations so happy for you both!!’ Last month, Paris shared an update on her and Carter’s journey to parenthood and revealed she has eggs ‘stocked and ready’ for IVF transfer next year. The reality star initially began the IVF process during the pandemic when lockdowns were in place. Paris recently denied her mother’s claims that she and Carter were ‘struggling’ with IVF and explained at The Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Entertainment Gala: ‘We started going and doing it like a few months in because the world was shut down. ‘We knew we wanted to start a family, and I was like, “This is perfect timing. Usually, I’m on a plane 250 days out of the year, and let’s just get all of the eggs stocked and ready,” and we have tons of them just waiting. ‘We really wanted to enjoy our first year of marriage together as a couple, you know, before bringing kids into the mix. So now that we just had our year anniversary, I can’t wait for 2023.’ Got a story?
