We can dress January up as a fresh start all we want, but in reality, it’s a dull and dreary month after the sparkle of Christmas. Thankfully, there are ways to brighten up the darkness – and one of these magic tricks is making smarter sartorial choices. If you find yourself reaching for the blacks, greys, browns and darker hues, you’re feeding into the overall negative vibe of the month. However, if you instead gravitate towards pops of colour, your mood and outlook is prompted to improve. Even one technicolour piece has the power to change your day, and those who fear eye-catching clothing don’t have to worry, as they can subtly get in on the trend with accessories. Why not try Converse’s baby blue Chuck Taylors? Or add Arket’s multicoloured hair claw to a simple day look? A rainbow jumper is an easy way to level up your everyday looks, while statement trousers and ‘clashing’ shoes and bags will see you inundated with compliments, brightening up your day even further. Whether you’re ready to jump in with all over rainbows or want to embrace new shades in a less obvious way, the high street is packed with options. We’ve rounded up the pieces that’ll see you doing January in colour. This article contains affiliate links.
