Prince Harry’s popularity has sunk to an all-time low following a number of explosive claims about the royal family, a new poll has found. Almost two-thirds (64%) of Britons say they have a negative view of the Duke of Sussex, up from 58% in May, with just a quarter (26%) seeing him in a positive light, according to the YouGov survey. This comes just before Harry’s memoir Spare officially hits the shelves tomorrow. The book was accidentally released early in Spain last week, immediately sparking a media frenzy over claims Prince William physically attacked Harry in a row over Meghan Markle. Harry’s net favourability among the British public is currently at a record low of minus 38, with Meghan even lower at minus 42. The King’s youngest son’s score among Labour voters is minus seven, although the proportion of positive and negative views of Harry was equal among 18 to 24-year-olds (41%). Likewise, Meghan still has a positive net favourability score of +10 among this younger age group, but it has dropped considerably from +55 in 2017. Meghan is currently least popular with Conservative and Leave voters, with over 80% of those polled holding a negative opinion of her. Among Harry’s explosive stories in the book include claims he killed 25 people in Afghanistan, how he took cocaine and magic mushrooms as a teenager, and how he lost his virginity to an older woman in a field behind a pub. In television interviews promoting the book, the duke said he is ‘not texting’ his brother. He also described his step-mother, Queen Camilla, as a ‘villain’ who ‘sacrificed me on her personal PR altar’ after his mother’s death, as well as criticising royal family members for a ‘really horrible reaction’ when the Queen died. YouGov surveyed 1,693 adults in the UK at the end of last week. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
