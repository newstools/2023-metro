A US college student was found dead in his dorm after suffering an ‘inhumane and cruel hazing’ at a fraternity. Luke Morgan Tyler, 19, was discovered in his room at Washington State University last January after police received an anonymous call. A petition has now been launched by Luke’s friends asking detectives to investigate Theta Chi fraternity house over claims he was drinking there just before his death. Organiser Trevor Michalski wrote: ‘His death directly followed a long and cruel pledging process allowed by his fraternity, Theta Chi. ‘Their inhumane and cruel hazing forced Luke and many others to do things nobody should ever be forced to do. ‘We demand that Theta Chi be investigated, shut down and the fraternity’s president, as well as pledge masters and others with power in the fraternity be investigated for their involvement with the death of Luke Tyler. ‘Luke was truly an amazing person with an incredible affect on everyone whose life he touched, he deserves justice.’ The petition has now reached 9,700 signatures. However, police have asked people not to speculate over the cause of Luke’s death. ‘There has been a significant amount of conjecture regarding the circumstances surrounding this incident and the actual cause of the student’s passing,’ a police spokesperson told 4 News Now. ‘I would caution the public against speculation at this point in the investigation. The facts in this case are still being gathered. ‘It could be several weeks before the coroner’s office determines the cause and manner of death. We want to ensure that the investigation can proceed unimpeded.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted the Theta Chi fraternity for comment. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
