Whether it’s a quick bite on-the-go, or on a hangover, McDonald’s always delivers when we need it the most. But this month you can also get your go-to Maccies treats for a discount. The fast food chain has just launched a January sale – which means you can enjoy your favourites for less. Running for two weeks from today, Monday January 16, McDonald’s has launched a new year sale – with offers exclusively available via the app. There’s a different promotion running every day until January 27. Today, for example, customers can get a core item (such as a Big Mac) for £1.59. Other discounts throughout the two-week sale period include 10% off when you spend £10 and £1.99 for a core item. It’s worth pointing out that these deals will only be available on the app on orders for collection or delivery – and delivery charges still apply, so be wary of this when ordering. Likewise, these discounts can’t be redeemed through third-party apps like Uber Eats or Just Eat. It could be the perfect time to snap up new menu items – such as the spicy sriracha chicken wrap – for less. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
