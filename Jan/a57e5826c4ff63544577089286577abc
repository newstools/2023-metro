Amazon has said it plans to shut three UK warehouses in a move which will impact 1,200 jobs. All three sites could shut this year. Sites in Hemel Hempstead, Doncaster and Gourock, in the west of Scotland, have been proposed for closure. It is understood that all workers at the sites will be offered roles at other Amazon locations. An spokesperson from the company said: ‘We’re always evaluating our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our employees and customers. ‘As part of that effort, we may close older sites, enhance existing facilities, or open new sites, and we’ve launched a consultation on the proposed closure of three fulfilment centres in 2023.’ Amazon has also revealed plans for two new major fulfilment centres in Peddimore, West Midlands, and Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, which will create 2,500 jobs over the next three years. The news comes after plans were announced to fire more than 18,000 staff worldwide. It will be the largest layoffs programme in its history as the company plans to try and cut costs across its business. The job losses will include employees from the UK and Europe. Amazon employs around 1.5 million people globally and had warned in November it was planning to cut up to 10,000 workers. Got a story?
