Yup, move over butterfly clips and phone charms, it’s all about noughties hats in 2023. The actress was spotted channelling her beloved character Andy Sachs, from The Devil Wears Prada, during Haute Couture week in Paris. She paired a sleek, black pageboy cap with black sunglasses, a navy overcoat and wide leg jeans – for a simple and sophisticated off-duty look. For those not clued-up, a pageboy cap is pretty much the same thing as a baker boy hat – except for a few minor details. As celeb stylist Lauren Glazer tells Metro.co.uk: ‘One could say that they are more or less the same style cap as they vary between designer anyway. ‘If you were to get technical, often the baker boy cap can be seen as smarter with slightly more height.’ Semantics out the way, this isn’t the first time Anne has been spotted donning the noughties classic. Earlier this month, she was seen wearing the same cap, this time with a bold Moncler puffer. Iconic. Men aren’t exempt from the revival either: Cruz Beckham was spotted wearing a very similar baker boy cap in October last year. As Lauren says: ‘All you need to know is that the Y2K classic is really making a comeback this season – and it’s becoming increasingly popular both on and off the runways.’ Want to get in on the trend?
