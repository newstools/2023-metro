Chelsea will submit a fresh bid for Lyon star Malo Gusto this week after Manchester United made contact with the defender. The 19-year-old right-back was the subject of a £25m bid from the Blues earlier this week but Lyon turned down the approach. The Ligue 1 giants value Gusto at around £40m and they’re in no rush to sell the teenager. United have long tracked Gusto’s development and they felt it was bad for his progress to remain at Lyon until at least the end of the season, if not for another 18 months. But Chelsea’s interest has forced United to act, with the Red Devils reportedly asking Gusto to stay at Lyon for the time being before the club make a move for him this summer. But Gusto is keen on a move now and Fabrizio Romano says the defender has already agreed personal terms with Chelsea. It’s therefore left to Chelsea to agree a fee with Lyon for the defender and it’s said they will submit a new bid in the coming days. Chelsea have already spent £160m this month, following a £280m spree last summer. Todd Boehly, though, is keen on showing his backing for Graham Potter in the window.
