Arsenal have agreed a £12 million fee with Chelsea to sign Jorginho, according to reports. The Gunners are desperate to bolster Mikel Arteta’s squad with a new central midfielder before the January transfer window closes on Tuesday evening. Arsenal have made Moises Caicedo their priority target but two bids – including a £70 million offer – have been rejected by Brighton so far. The Premier League leaders are exploring alternative options and a lower-cost solution would be signing Jorginho from Chelsea. The Italy international has entered the final six months of his contract but it’s understood that Chelsea were holding out for a £15m to £20m transfer fee. According to The Athletic, a £12m agreement has now been agreed between Arsenal and Chelsea, and the 31-year-old is due to travel to the Gunners’ training ground on Tuesday to finalise his move. The report claims that Jorginho will sign a contract with Arsenal until 2024 and it will include the option to extend a further year. Chelsea, meanwhile, remain in talks with Benfica to sign Enzo Fernandez. Argentina’s World Cup winner is keen to make the move to Stamford Bridge before the deadline but Chelsea are struggling to agree a fee with Benfica, who want the Premier League club to pay the midfielder’s €120m (£105.4m) release clause.
