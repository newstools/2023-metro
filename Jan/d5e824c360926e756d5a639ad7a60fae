It might only be the first day of 2023 but the royal family is set for another bombshell memoir from the Sussex family, reports say. Hot on the heels of Prince Harry’s book, Spare, Meghan Markle is said to be ‘contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the Royal limelight… and leaving no stone unturned’. ‘I would find it surprising if Meghan didn’t publish her own story, to be honest,’ a Hollywood agent told The Mail on Sunday. ‘Spare is clearly Prince Harry’s chance to tell his, but hers is equally compelling. I mean, how many actresses end up marrying a Prince?’ It wouldn’t be Meghan’s first book as she already branched out into children’s literature with the publication of The Bench. The Sussexes are also planning to release a wellness book as part of their four-book deal with Penguin Random House. Commentators believe the mystery fourth will be Meghan’s hotly anticipated autobiography. Hitting the shelves in little over a week, Harry’s Spare is billed as being written with ‘raw, unflinching honesty’. King Charles is expected to avoid any criticism, but Harry is reportedly extremely critical of Prince William. There are fears its release will permanently damage the already fractured relationship between the once close brothers. A source told The Times: ‘Generally, I think the book [will be] worse for them than the royal family is expecting. ‘Everything is laid bare. Charles comes out of it better than it had expected, but it’s tough on William, in particular, and even Kate gets a bit of a broadside. ‘There are these minute details, and a description of the fight between the brothers. I personally can’t see how Harry and William will be able to reconcile after this.’ Harry is set to launch a publicity blitz next Sunday with an interview on America’s flagship 60 Minutes. He will also be interviewed by ITV’s Tom Bradby in the UK. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
