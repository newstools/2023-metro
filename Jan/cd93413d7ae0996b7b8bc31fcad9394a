A boy left in a coma after a helicopter crash in which his mum was killed has woken up. Nicholas Tadros, 10, has opened his eyes and held his dad’s hand after the crash two weeks ago. Staff at the Queensland Children’s Hospital in Brisbane say his condition is now ‘critical but stable’. Priest Father Suresh Kumar posted on social media that Nicholas has ‘been off life support now for a few days and his body has responded very well’. ‘They have lowered his sedation medicine at times to see if he is responsive and he has woken up and [been] able to respond to some questions with a nod or a shake of the head,’ he added. ‘He is also able to hold his dad’s hand.’ He said dad Simon Tadros passed on the information about his son. Nicholas is set to have more operations in the coming days and remains on a ventilator to support his breathing. The boy’s mum, 36-year-old Vanessa Tadros, was killed when two helicopters crashed near the Sea World theme park on the Gold Coast on January 2. She was buried today after a funeral near the family’s home in Sydney. Three others were killed – British couple Ron Hughes, 65, and Diane Hughes, 57, and pilot Ash Jenkinson, 40 – and mum Winnie de Silva, 33, and her son Leon, 9, remain in hospital but are stable. Two couples from New Zealand in the other aircraft miraculously survived the crash, calling it a ‘joy ride turned into a nightmare’. The Air Transport Safety Bureau in Australia said it is continuing to investigate what happened. ‘We now have a painstaking job of trying to recreate exactly what’s occurred in the lead up to this,’ its chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said. ‘We know the take-off and the landing phases of any aircraft operations are critical phases of flight, where the the cognitive workload of pilots are at their greatest.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
