Alexis Sanchez says Arsenal ‘will always be in my heart’ ahead of their Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday. The Premier League leaders, who boast an eight-point advantage over Manchester City, host Erik ten Hag’s side at the Emirates Stadium in Sunday’s late kick-off. Ahead of the game, Arsenal have been replaying some of their best goals scored against United in recent years on their social media channels. One of the goals was Sanchez’s superb strike in Arsenal’s 3-0 win over United at the Emirates Stadium in 2015. And the post did not escape Sanchez’s attention as the 34-year-old, who left the Gunners to join United in 2018, was moved by Arsenal’s decision to highlight his goal. ‘You remembered me. I will never forget you too,’ Sanchez wrote in response to Arsenal’s post on Instagram. ‘You will always be in my heart. You were my first family in England. ‘And everyone took good care of me especially the fans. All the best Gunners.’ Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta insists his Arsenal players must have both the mental and physical qualities in order to win the Premier League title this season. ‘Having those qualities, that balance in the squad is necessary,’ said Arteta. ‘To have the mentality and capacity to control emotions required to play on the big stage is very necessary. ‘The physical aspect is necessary, too. Without that you cannot compete over 11 months in the conditions in which we work. ‘We haven’t been in a title race for many years. Words mean absolutely nothing, we have to do it on the pitch.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
