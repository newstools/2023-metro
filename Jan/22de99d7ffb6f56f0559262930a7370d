Avengers actor Jeremy Renner is in a ‘critical but stable’ condition following a snow plow accident. The Marvel actor, 51, who is dad to Ava, nine, sustained injuries following a ‘weather-related accident’ while plowing snow on the weekend. It was earlier reported by Deadline that Renner was involved in an accident and was airlifted to hospital on Sunday. In a statement, reps said he is ‘receiving excellent care’. They confirmed in a statement to Metro.co.uk: ‘We can confirm Jeremy is in critical but stable condition with injuries suffered after experiencing a weather related accident while plowing snow earlier today. ‘His family is with him and he is receiving excellent care.’ It was previously reported by Reno Gazette-Journal that Renner has a home near Mt. Rose – Ski Tahoe, which saw a winter storm hit on New Year’s Eve. Local Nevada press reported 35,000 homes across Northern Nevada’s Washoe, Carson, Douglas, Storey and Lyon counties were without power due to the weather. While it’s not clear where Renner sustained his injuries, in 2015 he shared an image to his Instagram of a snowcat vehicle used to travel over snowy terrain in difficult conditions. In November he shared a spirited clip of a car driving on snow, writing in the comments: ‘Monday morning Pre winter preparation couldn’t be more fun !! #reno #tahoe.’ The Mayor of Kingstown actor Renner is a two-time Oscar nominee – for his roles in The Hurt Locker (2008) and The Town (2010) – and may be best known for his titular role in Marvel’s Hawkeye, starring in the Disney Plus series as well as the Avengers and Captain America films.
