Prince Harry has defended Lady Susan Hussey over the racist comments she made to a charity founder at Buckingham Palace. The Duke of Sussex said the reaction from the press to the incident between Lady Susan Hussey and Ngozi Fulani was ‘horrendous’. He told Tom Bradby on ITV: ‘All we’ve ever asked for in the last – certainly the last few years – is some accountability. ‘And I’m very happy for Ngozi Fulani to be invited into the palace to sit down with Lady Susan Hussey and to reconcile, because Meghan and I love Susan Hussey. (Meghan) thinks she’s great. ‘And I also know that what she meant – she never meant any harm at all. ‘But the response from the British press, and from people online because of the stories that they wrote was horrendous.’ The Queen’s former lady-in-waiting quit an honorary role after asking Ms Fulani during an event at Buckingham Palace where she really came from.
