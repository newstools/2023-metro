Manchester United have avoided Manchester City in the FA Cup fifth round draw while non-league Wrexham will face Premier League opposition if they win their fourth-round replay. The FA Cup appears more open than in years gone by after holders Liverpool became the latest top Premier League to crash out of the competition. Arsenal, who have won the FA Cup a record 14 times, and eight-time winners Chelsea are also out. Seven non-Premier League clubs were in the hat for the last-16 draw, including non-league side Wrexham and League Two outfit Grimsby Town. The fifth-round ties will be played on the week commencing February 27, with the 2023 FA Cup final set to be held at Wembley on June 3. Premier League champions Man City will visit Championship club Bristol City while 12-time winners Man United face either Derby County or West Ham, who play on Monday night. Wrexham, the only non-league team still in the draw, conceded an injury-time goal as Sheffield United forced a replay in an entertaining 3-3 draw played in front of Wrexham owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. The winner of the replay at Bramall Lane will face Antonio Conte’s Tottenham, currently fifth in the Premier League and into the knockout stages of the Champions League. Elsewhere, Stoke City host Brighton – who knocked out holders Liverpool with a 2-1 win at the Amex Stadium – while Southampton will face either Luton Town or League Two side Grimsby. Leicester City will fancy their chances against Championship clubs Blackburn or Birmingham and Leeds United travel to the winner of Fulham v Sunderland after a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage.
