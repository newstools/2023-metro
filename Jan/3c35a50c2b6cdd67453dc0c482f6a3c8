A father-of-two was caught drink-driving when he crashed his van on his way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, a court heard. Richard Juniper, 35, was more than two-and-a-half times over the limit when his Ford Transit van veered into another car. He had been to a pub before heading to the counselling session after ending 11 months of sobriety when his relationship broke down, prosecutor Sumreen Asfar said. Bedroom fitter Juniper, of Leddington, Gloucestershire, admitted the charges and was banned from driving for 22 months and fined £303 at Worcester magistrates’ court. He was not aware he had hit a car in Malvern, Worcestershire, on November 24 last year, until being told by police, his lawyer Belinda Ariss said. ‘He is embarrassed and upset with himself that he had let himself, his family and children down by having another drink. He’s not had any alcohol to drink since,’ she added. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
