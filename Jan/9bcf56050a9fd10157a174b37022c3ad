Piers Morgan marked his return to Twitter by making a rather expected swipe at Prince Harry. The controversial presenter, 57, has been silent on the social networking platform for almost a fortnight after being hacked over the Christmas period, however, made a comeback during the final minutes of the Duke of Sussex’s explosive ITV interview with Tom Bradby. During the bombshell chat, Prince Harry, 38, shared that how he was convinced his mum, Princess Diana, was ‘still alive’ after her death in August 1997, aged 36. He also accused his family of ‘getting into bed with the devil’ to rehabilitate their image. Before the interview came to an end, Morgan returned to Twitter by sharing a poster of ‘British Tits’ which included a variety of different species, including a blue tit, bearded tit, great tit, and crested tit. Also on the poster was a picture of Prince Harry with the caption ‘colossal’. After the interview finished broadcasting, he tweeted: ‘Never seen an unhappier “happy man” in my life. ‘Prince Harry’s a bitter, delusional, paranoid, family-trashing halfwit exposing & exploiting the Royals’ most personal secrets for gazillions whilst wanging on with jaw-dropping hypocrisy about media intrusion. He’s pathetic.’ (sic) A pretty predictable reaction from Morgan, right? Elsewhere, Morgan has confirmed that he will return to his TalkTV show on Monday night following his hiatus over Christmas. ‘I’ll be back on@PiersUncensored tomorrow night… suspect it will be a rather lively show,’ he penned. Harry: The Interview is available to stream on ITVX. Got a story?
