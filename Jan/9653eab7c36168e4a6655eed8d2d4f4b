This is the disturbing moment a King’s Guard confessed he was ‘staring at a duck’ instead of ‘looking after’ the Royal Family. A 20-second video shared on TikTok shows the young man filming himself while on duty at Windsor Castle. ‘I am currently standing outside Windsor Castle,’ he can be heard saying to the camera. ‘I am meant to be looking after the Royal Family. Currently staring at two ducks. Do I care? No.’ The clip appears to have been uploaded to TikTok by someone else, rather than the soldier himself. The caption read, ‘Queen’s guard taking the p*** on post’, implying it happened before the death of Her Majesty. His comments about his duty seem to have shocked many on the app, especially fans of the Royal Family. One person said: ‘How to make yourself really unpopular at work really quick.’ Another replied, ‘Ex-Queen’s Guard’, while many joked the man has probably lost his job already. ‘Wow can’t trust anyone these days. He’s getting paid for this,’ another comment read. It is yet unclear when the video was filmed, or who the soldier behind it is, but it was only uploaded over the weekend. The King’s Guard and King’s Life Guard are the contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences. Windsor Castle is where King Charles hosted his first annual Christmas dinner for the wider Royal Family as a monarch. Metro.co.uk has contacted the British Army for a comment.
