There’s a new sex toy that’s joined the party and now its users are screaming they will never be using a regular vibrator again after the fun they’ve had. So Divine’s Pearl Vibe 2in1 G-spot & Suction Stimulator has got a double-pronged design for dual pleasure and it’s leaving its customers very satisfied. Just days into the new year, one happy customer has been left stunned by the So Divine toy after years of an orgasm drought. The poor woman thought she would never hit that O again. With a five-star review, she wrote: ‘I was apprehensive at first, but this toy is worth every single penny! ‘I hadn’t had an orgasm for seven years and was starting to think I never would again. However, within minutes, this toy had me orgasming. Turns out I just needed the right stimulation!’ What a happy way to start the year! While another user said: ‘I’m never going back to a normal vibrator after trying this!’ The Pearl Vibe G-spot Suction Stimulator leaves nothing to chance as it gives a mix of external and internal stimulation. The suction stimulator targets the clitoris, whilst the internal G-spot vibrator massages your G-spot for an intense blended orgasm. To find a mode that suits you depending on the mood you’re in, there are 11 suction intensities and three speeds, plus seven G-spot patterns, meaning there are 21 ways to feel the vibe. The Pearl Vibe has even got a flexible tip to cater for everyone’s shape and size so we all get that O that we need. You can get 20% off Pearl Vibe using the code: PearlVibe20 here.
