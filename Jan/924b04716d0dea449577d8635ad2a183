Three tiny puppies have been found near a pile of rubbish in Wiltshire. The sickly weeks-old pups were dumped in a cardboard box on the side of a road. RSPCA Animal Rescue Officer Freya Lamb, who is now investigating the case, said: ‘These poor puppies are all sadly underweight and suffering with ear mites. ‘One of the dogs also has cherry eye which needs veterinary treatment. ‘They are very nervous and scared and don’t want to go near anyone.’ The puppies were taken by a member of the public to the charity’s Oak and Furrows Wildlife Centre. They’ve now been named Mary, Holly and Rudey, as a nod to their festive season rescue. Sadly, the RSPCA has seen a 25% rise in abandonment incidents being dealt with by its teams. Previous figures released by the charity show the number of animals being abandoned rose by a concerning 17% from 2020 to 2021. There was also a further increase of 24% in the first part of 2022. If anyone has any information about the abandoned pups, please contact the RSPCA inspectorate appeal line on 0300 123 8018. Do you have a story to share?
