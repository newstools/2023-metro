Chelsea have agreed yet another signing this month, although the Lyon full-back Malo Gusto will not be making teh move to west London until the summer. The Athletic report that ‘an agreement in principle’ has been reached between the Premier League and Ligue 1 clubs, with Chelsea set to pay €30m (£26.3m) up front, with add-ons to come. The 19-year-old will not be coming straight to Stamford Bridge, though, staying with Lyon for the rest of the season and then linking up with his new teammates over the summer, although he will undergo a medical with the Blues this month. Gusto is being brought in as back-up for Reece James, who has suffered injuries on a worryingly regular basis, but clearly he will not provide that back-up for the rest of this campaign. James is now fit again after the two knee injuries he has suffered this season and may return in Chelsea’s next fixture, at home against Fulham in the Premier League on 3 February. It seems that they will get through to the end of the season with the options they have and then see Gusto provide competition to the England international later this year. The teenager will become the seventh player Chelsea have bought this month, having already brought in Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana, Joao Felix, Andrey Santos, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke. There could still be a move for a midfielder to come before the transfer window shuts next week, with the Blues linked to the likes of Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandes and Amadou Onana.
