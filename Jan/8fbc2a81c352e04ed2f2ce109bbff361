If you love nothing more than being alone with your thoughts while surrounded by stunning scenery, a new property listing could be for you. A tropical island in Central America is up for sale – and it won’t set you back millions. Iguana Island, a volcanic spot 12 miles off the coast of Bluefields, Nicaragua, has just hit the market – and it costs less than the price of the average London flat. It’s up for sale at £376,627 – which is more than £130,000 less than the average flat price in the capital (coming in at £511,594, according to Rightmove). It’s considerably larger too – with five acres to play with in total. The coconut palm and banana tree-lined island also boasts a three-bed house as well as a 28-foot observation tower – great for panoramic views. There’s plenty of space to add a swimming pool for those looking to put their own stamp on it and there’s a dock on the west side of the island – ideal for fishing. It’s also not totally cut off from the world, as there’s access to WiFi, phone and TV signal. According to the description, Iguana Island also comes with its own staff, including an on-site manager and caretakers – who are willing to stay on with the island’s new owners. The incredible spot definitely puts house-hunting in the UK in perspective. You can find the full listing here. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
