The Beckhams, Stacey Solomon and the Kardashian-Jenner family are among the famous faces who rang in the New Year in style as we waved hello to 2023. David Beckham, 47, took to social media to share a gorgeous photograph of himself alongside his wife Victoria, 48, and children Romeo, 20, Cruz, 17, and Harper, 11, under a display of fireworks, but admitted they were ‘missing’ their eldest son Brooklyn, 23, who presumably spent the occasion with his wife Nicola Peltz. Loose Women panellist Stacey, 33 – who recently shocked fans by revealing she is eight months pregnant with her fifth child – decided that New Year’s Eve was the perfect way to enter nesting mode ahead of her new arrival. She wrote to her Instagram followers: ‘I honestly can’t sit still. I feel like I spent 2022 sorting lovely people’s lives out and mines a bit of a mess. So I’m going to try and get myself sorted this year… I feel like I’m going to be that annoying person on a mission before baby comes. ‘I’m going to try and sort myself out one small thing at a time every day in Jan. So if anyone fancies a good clear out and start over maybe we can do it together & motivate each other. I’m so excited to start nesting. 2023 let’s do this!’ As the clock struck 12, Stacey shared a video of herself and husband Joe Swash in bed, saying: ‘Happy New Year! We’re just in bed, we’ve been in bed for a few hours. We made it to the fireworks, though, yay!’ Laughing, she continued, ‘Joe, you look like you’re about to go,’ to which he responded: ‘I am very tired.’ ‘We are such old fogies,’ Stacey continued. ‘I hope you’re having a more exciting New Year than us. Happy 2023, woo!’ she finished. Friends star Courteney Cox, 58, who spent the New Year in London with her Snow Patrol member boyfriend Johnny McDaid, 46, shared a snap of the pair enjoying a kiss as she wished her followers a ‘happy GMT New Year!’ Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, 51, shared a gorgeous photo of herself alongside her daughters Lexi, 16, and Hollie, 10, enjoying their Mauritius holiday. ‘Happiest of nights to you all. Here’s to a cracking 2023 🥂,’ she captioned the post. As celebrations got underway Stateside, Kylie Jenner, 25, kicked off proceedings, sharing clips of herself, sister Kendall Jenner, 27, and pals including Hailey Bieber, 26, enjoying a sit-down meal before partying into the early hours. Meanwhile, Kylie and Kendall’s elder sister Khloe Kardashian, 38, shared a boomerang of herself lifting light-up 2023 glasses from her eyes, alongside a sweet picture of her and four-year-old daughter True’s matching nails for the occasion. Others who decided to stay at home to say goodbye to 2022 were Hilaria Baldwin, 38, who shared a gorgeous snap of her and her husband Alec’s seven children in plastic top hats, blowing party poppers and wearing 2023 glasses. Demi Moore, 60, stunned in a white jumpsuit as she twirled around her living room holding her beloved dog Pilaf. Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan, 40, shared a snap of himself relaxing with 62-year-old Stanley Tucci as they celebrated the turning of the New Year with their respective wives Amelia Warner and Felicity Blunt. Gigi Hadid, 27, gave fans a glimpse of her two-year-old daughter Khai, who she shares with former One Direction star Zayn Malik, holding onto a gold-studded Prada bag. ‘HAPPY NEW YEAR Y’ALL :)’ she wrote. ‘Sending biiiig love & wishing u the best.’ The cast of Selling Sunset wrapped up the celebrations with heavily-pregnant Heather Rae El Moussa, 35, sharing a photo of herself with her husband Tarik and his children Taylor, 12, and Brayden, seven. ‘Happy New Years Eve!! This NYE definitely looks a little bit different- no cheersing champagne at midnight but I do have Martinellis 🍾 and honestly no promises that I’ll even make it to midnight 😆 but I wouldn’t want it any other way,’ she wrote. Her co-star Chrishell Stause filmed herself partying on a balcony with her partner G Flip and friends as they listened to Miley Cyrus’ Party In The USA. Got a story?
