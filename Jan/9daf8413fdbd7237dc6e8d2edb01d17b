Doja Cat raised some eyebrows, including her own, as she sported a chic moustache and beard made of fake eyelashes at the 2023 Paris Fashion Week. The Woman rapper carefully placed the pretty huge false lashes on her chin and top lip to create a beard and moustache, and used them for eyebrows too – and we kinda dig it. Channeling sophisticated European vibes, the 27-year-old wore a tan and white oversized pinstripe suit and some cool blue-tinted glasses to complete the, erm, look, as she arrived for the Viktor and Rolf Spring/Summer 2023 Haute Couture show. The Kiss Me More singer seemed to be inspired by comments about an outfit she had worn earlier in the week, which featured shaved eyebrows. ‘If lashes are what you all want, lashes are what you’ll get,’ the rapper wrote on her Instagram story ahead of the event. The eyebrow-less outfit in question was that iconic red dress by fashion house Schiaparelli, which Doja Cat casually accessorized with 30,000 red Swarovski crystals earlier in the week. We love Doja’s commitment to a look, and last night was no exception. Artist Hayden Williams agreed as he commented on the look: ‘It’s camp!! Doja is committed to a look and will wear it with conviction for sure 👏🏾.’ Heidi Klum simple wrote: ‘I love you 😍,’ while rapper Ice Spice responded with a crying emoji. But Doja’s outfit choices aren’t the ones that have necessarily raised the most eyebrows this week. Kylie Jenner’s outfit, awkwardly also by Schiaparelli, got people talking as she donned a black dress with a huge very realistic lion head protruding out of its side. Uploading a picture of her outfit to Instagram, Kylie said: ‘BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. thank you @danielroseberry and @schiaparelli for such a special morning. wow i loved wearing this faux art creation constructed by hand using manmade materials. beautiful beautiful [sic].’ But many failed to share the star’s enthusiasm, as they questioned whether the star was promoting animal cruelty and hunting. While animal rights group Peta noted Kylie’s outfit could have been a stand against trophy hunting, Carrie Johnson, wife of the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and animal rights campaigner wrote it was ‘grim’. ‘Real or fake this just promotes trophy hunting. Yuck,’ she added. In a second questionable outfit choice, the day after Kylie wore an electric blue dress with a problematic necklace, that appeared to resemble a noose. It was slammed for being insensitive towards suicide, while the noose’s history with slavery was also pointed out. As of yet, Doja Cat’s outfits, although wild, aren’t causing quite as much of a stir. Got a story?
