McDonald’s and fine dining don’t normally appear in the same sentence. Until now, that is. A McDonald’s in Wales has been endorsed by a Michelin-starred chef. Gareth Ward who runs Ynyshir, the UK’s official best restaurant, has named a McDonald’s in Welshpool as the ‘best in the world’ – saying the offering at this particular branch is ‘on a different level.’ The chef revealed it was one of the best restaurants in Wales overall – behind his own, of course. Speaking to Wales Online, he said: ‘I’m telling you now, Welshpool McDonald’s is on a different level. It’s just got different elements to everyone else. ‘It’s just absolutely smashing it. Last time I had a crispy chicken and it definitely had something like truffle mayonnaise on it. I don’t think it did, but it tasted like it did. ‘Everybody I speak to says this is, by far, the best McDonald’s in the world. Welshpool McDonald’s that’s what it’s all about.’ Gareth also highlighted Baravin in Aberystwyth – which he praised for its Caesar salads, and a fish and chip shop called Caersws Fish Bar, for its creative techniques and dishes. It’s clear Gareth knows his stuff too, as his spot Ynyshir scooped the award for best restaurant at the National Restaurant Awards held in June last year – becoming the first outside London to claim the title since the awards began, 16 years ago.
