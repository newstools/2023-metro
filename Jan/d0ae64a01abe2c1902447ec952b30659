A Met officer who was raped by colleague David Carrick said she never reported it because she was worried it would ruin her career. The woman, who has lifelong anonymity as sexual violence victim, has spoken out about her experience with Carrick, after meeting him in 2004. Using the pseudonym Michelle, the officer, who is still serving, told ITV how Carrick first seemed like ‘a really charming friendly guy’. But she also noticed she was ‘a bit of a womaniser’ who ‘flirted a lot’ and would ‘smack the backside of a female officer’. The pair started spending time together after work and Carrick’s behaviour grew more and more controlling. If he saw Michelle speaking with another male officer at work, he would join to listen to their conversation. One night, he took her to his house and raped her, Michelle said. But Michelle did not feel she could report what happened to her because of the culture at work. She said: ‘I knew a male officer’s and female officer’s word against one another was never going to go my way. ‘No one was going to believe me over him. I saw it as the end of my career and potentially a very difficult time so, no, I wasn’t going to say anything.’ It was only in 2021, when another woman came forward with allegations against Carrick that Michelle realised he had hurt others. She said she feels more comfortable speaking out now that the culture at the Met ‘has changed with the new commissioner’. Carrick, 48, pleaded guilty to a total of 49 offences that took place between 2003 and 2020. He met some of his victims on dating sites including Tinder and Badoo, or at social occasions, convincing them he could be trusted because he was a police officer. The Met, who missed several opportunities to stop Carrick, has apologised. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
