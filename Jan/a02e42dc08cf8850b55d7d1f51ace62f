A drug dealer has been jailed after nine bags of cocaine were found stashed in a magnetic box fitted underneath his car. Aloisios Varthalitis, 24, was driving his Fiat Punto through Tonbridge, Kent, when he was pulled over by officers who suspected him of supplying drugs. They soon found the box containing the drugs under the driver’s side door, as well as two phones and £320 cash. A search of his home unearthed another magnetic box containing more cocaine, bringing the total value of the seized drugs to around £400. Forensic examination of his phones also uncovered texts related to drug dealing. Varthalitis, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, pleaded guilty this week to possessing cocaine with intent to supply and possession of criminal property. He was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court to two years and 11 months in jail and also had to forfeit the cash and car. Amanda Lissenden of Kent Police said: ‘Another dealer who has brought misery to the streets of west Kent towns is quite rightly starting a prison sentence. ‘Our local police officers are relentless in their efforts to track down these criminals and, as shown in this case, will complete comprehensive searches to find their drugs – wherever they are hidden.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
