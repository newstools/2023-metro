Brits have woken up to further weather warnings on the first day of the new year. The Met Office has issued seven yellow warnings for ice, which are set to last from 6pm today until 11am tomorrow. The alerts are in place for large parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and the Humber. People have been urged to watch out for icy patches on some roads, pavements and cycle paths. Another warning was also issued for snow in Perth and Stirling, and is expected to last until midday. The weather will remain cold and cloudy for much of Scotland today with rain and hill snow. Elsewhere, there are some sunny spells but also some showers, mainly in the west. More persistent rain will unfortunately returning to southern England later today. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Helen Caughey said: ‘It will be an unsettled New Year weekend for much of the UK. ‘New Year’s Eve will be followed by a more mixed New Year’s Day, with Scotland seeing the bulk of the unsettled conditions, with spells of rain, turning to snow over higher ground, continuing to push north. ‘While it will be mild across the south, it will remain colder in the north with an ice risk in places here early on Sunday. ‘Elsewhere, a drier day is expected, although with some showers, mainly across western areas, ahead of conditions becoming more widely settled into Monday.’ Got a story?
