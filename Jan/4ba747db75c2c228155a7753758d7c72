Love Island’s winter series is right around the corner, with less than a fortnight to wait until the reality show’s hotly anticipated return to ITV2. The network has confirmed that the new chapter will launch on Monday, January 16 from 9pm, so cancel all your plans and set those calendar alerts. The first edition of 2023 will mark Maya Jama’s hosting debut following presenter Laura Whitmore’s exit from the show last year. Maya, 28, looked radiant as hell in the five-second teaser, which was released last week, aptly dressed in a black sequined jumpsuit with gold embellished star sign detailing. News of Love Island’s official start date comes after it was announced that the latest batch of contestants will have to disable their social media accounts during the programme to protect both them and their families. For the first time, the broadcaster will ask islanders to make their accounts ‘dormant’ while they are in the villa so nothing can be published on their behalf and they avoid ‘the adverse effects of social media’. Contestants will also receive ‘guidance and training’ around ‘mutually respectful behaviour in relationships’ after the most recent series prompted thousands of complaints to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. Many of the complaints related to ‘alleged misogynistic and bullying behaviour’ although they were not upheld. Islanders will be offered resource links to read before meeting the other contestants to help them ‘identify negative behaviours in relationships’ and ‘understand the behaviour patterns associated with controlling and coercive behaviour’. The new measures have been introduced as part of ITV’s duty of care measures for 2023. Love Island returns Monday, January 16 at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. Got a story?
