They’re formulated with your toothpaste, they come as strips, solutions and powders. But they often contain some quite potent chemicals, potentially causing untold damage. MySweetSmile has developed a range of products that don’t rely on peroxide-based formulas like traditional whitening products. And when it comes to its Teeth Whitening Powder it uses the ingredient Pentasodium Triphosphate (PT), which aims to remove deep surface stains and prevent particles, such as those from coffee, wine or smoking, from building up on teeth post-treatment, potentially keeping teeth whiter for longer. It also contains Strontium Chloride, which aims to prevent tooth sensitivity. After rave reviews of the whitening powder, we put it to the test and here’s what we thought. Traditional whitening products use a peroxide-based formula that can cause tooth sensitivity and enamel damage. Instead, the brand uses a PAP-based formula in its products including the teeth whitening strips and teeth whitening pen which provides whitening results but without any nasty side effects. When it comes to MySweetSmile’s teeth whitening powder, it contains the aforementioned Pentasodium Triphosphate, as well as Calcium Carbonate, a gentle ingredient that works to remove plaque, debris, and surface stains to clean the tooth’s surface. Note: MySweetSmile’s Teeth Whitening Powder is not a direct replacement for toothpaste and has been designed for use before brushing with your regular toothpaste.
