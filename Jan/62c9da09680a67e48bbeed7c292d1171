Andy Carroll was booked twice and shown a red card during Reading’s 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in the FA Cup on Saturday night, and even Roy Keane thought the striker lacked discipline. It was reckless stuff from the former Newcastle and Liverpool striker, who had already picked up a yellow card and then slid in late on Casemiro, leaving the referee no choice but to send him off. The Royals were 2-0 down at that point, conceding again but actually grew into the match a bit from there, scoring a consolation, but were ultimately eliminated. Keane, who picked up seven red cards for United in the Premier League, could not deny there was some hypocrisy in his reaction, but still felt the big forward lacked discipline. ‘Ex-Liverpool, sometimes that plays on your mind, a bit of frustration being up there and not getting great service,’ Keane said on ITV as he made some excuses for Carroll. ‘But still, for an experienced player…that’s fine coming from me, I’ve never been sent off, but a bit more discipline.’ Reading manager, and former Manchester United star, Paul Ince was not critical of the striker after the game, saying the referee made a mistake in booking Carroll in the first place. ‘I don’t think let down is the word. The first one wasn’t actually a foul. The referee couldn’t wait to get his card out,’ he said. ‘After that, he’s got to be careful, he tries to pull out but once you’ve been booked you can’t be making them tackles.’ MORE : ‘It drives me crazy’ – Roy Keane fumes at Manchester United’s Tyrell Malacia MORE : Erik ten Hag explains decision to start Harry Maguire for Manchester United vs Reading For more stories like this, check our sport page.
