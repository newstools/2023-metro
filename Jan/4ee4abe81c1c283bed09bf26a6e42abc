This is the terrifying moment people who had gathered near Times Square in New York ran for their lives as gunshots sounded on New Year’s Eve. NYPD police opened fire on a 19-year-old man who attacked three officers with a machete. Unprovoked, he attempted to strike one officer over the head with the long blade before hitting two others in the head. At a news conference this morning, police commissioner Keechant L. Sewell said one of the cops fired their weapon, striking the suspect in the shoulder. The incident happened just after 10pm, just outside the secure area that had been set up for the New Year’s Eve celebrations. Videos shared on social media show partygoers fleeing an area a few streets away from where the annual ball drop was due to take place at midnight. Witnesses first reported hearing gunshots and seeing police rushing to the scene around 9.30 pm. ‘Unprovoked, a 19-year-old male approached an officer and attempted to strike him over the head with a machete,’ Ms Sewell said. ‘The male then struck two additional officers in the head with the machete.’ The three officers were rushed to a hospital where they are all in stable condition. One of those involved in the incident had graduated from the police academy on Friday. The suspect was also taken to hospital and is expected to recover. Mayor Eric Adams said earlier today: ‘We are really pleased by the response and how our officers handled this situation. ‘All three of the officers are in stable conditions and there are no critical threats to New Yorkers at this time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
