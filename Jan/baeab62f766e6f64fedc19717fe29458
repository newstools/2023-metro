Graham Potter led Chelsea’s pursuit of Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhailo Mudryk and views the club’s decision to hijack Arsenal’s move for the Ukrainian as a sign of confidence in him. The 22-year-old is set to attend Chelsea’s game against Crystal Palace today and could even be unveiled to the supporters. Chelsea struck late on Saturday night to clinch a deal for the winger, who had looked certain to join Arsenal. Mudryk has regularly spoken of his desire to move to the Emirates and he’s been uploading hints to his social media channels in recent weeks that’s fuelled speculation over a move to the Gunners. But the Gunners refused to meet Shakhtar’s £88m valuation of the winger, with Chelsea committing to doing so through a series of achievable add-ons. Having already signed Joao Felix on loan, Mudryk’s arrival is a huge coup for Potter. The Blues have lost seven of their last ten matches and there’s significant pressure building on the former Brighton boss from outside Stamford Bridge. But the Athletic say Potter led the club’s interest in Mudryk and made it clear how valuable the Ukraine international would be to transforming his side in west London. The club are blocking out the noise around Potter’s position and instead of giving him a public vote of confidence, they feel signing Mudryk is proof of their belief in Potter.
