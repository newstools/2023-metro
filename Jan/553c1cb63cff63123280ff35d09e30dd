Hooded fashion is having a moment. Be it scarves or dresses, hoods are featuring heavily in red carpet looks – you only have to look at Jenna Ortega’s recent stunning Saint Laurent dress to see the trend in action. A hooded dress might transport you straight back to the 00s, with visions of Kylie Minogue – but they have firmly returned to the fashion world in 2023. Kate Moss wore a sheer olive green silk jersey dress with a built-in hood to the Museum of Modern Art in New York last November, while Laura Harrier opted for a sleek brown YSL hooded dress for another red carpet look. Hoods add a new level of interest and drama to any outfit – not to mention they are an additional layer of protection against the wind and rain. But the best part is you can go as casual or dressed-up as you fancy – with all kinds of hooded options available. Keep it relaxed with a hooded jersey dress, or go all out with a formal hooded jumpsuit. Alternatively, dip your toe in the trend with a hooded scarf. The possibilities are endless.
