This is the aftermath of a Ukrainian strike on Russian-controlled territory in Donetsk. Footage shared online shows the destroyed quarters in the town of Makiivka after the New Year’s Eve explosion. A huge building believed to be a former vocational college can be seen reduced to nothing more than smoking rubble. Russia’s defence ministry said the missile strike killed at least 63 soldiers, in what is thought to be one of the biggest losses for Vladimir Putin’s army since the war started. Initial reports citing a source close to the Russian-appointed leadership in the city said ‘there are fewer than 100 killed so far’. But without claiming the missile strike, Ukraine’s defence ministry said as many as 400 Russians had been killed. It said the explosion was ‘a result of careless handling of heating devices’. Daniil Bezsonov, a senior Russian-installed official in the Moscow-controlled parts of the Donetsk region, said the building had suffered a ‘massive blow’ from US-made rockets. He said that according to preliminary reports, it was being used as personnel quarters. ‘There were dead and wounded, the exact number is still unknown,’ Mr Bezsonov said on Telegram. ‘The building itself was badly damaged.’ One Russian pro-war military blogger known as Rybar, who has some one million subscribers on the messaging app, said more than 100 people had been wounded in the strike and that rubble was still being cleared. He said there had been about 600 people in the building, and that ammunition had been stored in the same facility. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
