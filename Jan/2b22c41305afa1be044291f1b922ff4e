Mykhaylo Mudryk would favour a move to Arsenal ahead of Chelsea, according to reports. The two Premier League clubs are both in talks to sign the Shakhtar Donetsk winger this month, with Arsenal already submitting two offers for the winger. Arsenal’s opening bid of £35.5 million, plus a further £17.7m in add-ons, has been rejected by Shakhtar, while their follow-up offer still falls short of the Ukrainian club’s £85m valuation. Chelsea, meanwhile, have yet to formalise an offer for Mudryk but Shakhtar director Darijo Srna was in attendance at Stamford Bridge on Thursday evening as Graham Potter’s side were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. According to The Guardian, Chelsea remain ‘hopeful’ of signing Mudryk after holding ‘positive’ discussions with Shakhtar over a potential deal. However, the report claims that if Mudryk is given a choice between signing for Arsenal or Chelsea, the 22-year-old would opt to join Mikel Arteta’s side. Meanwhile, Shakhtar’s deputy sporting director, Carlo Nicolini, insists the Ukrainian club are in no rush to sell Mudryk and are using Manchester United’s £85m deal to sign Antony last summer as a price guide for their in-demand winger. ‘Given that we have no need for transfers, we said in due time that we evaluate the player stronger than some other profiles, such as Antony. This is the benchmark,’ Nicolini told CalcioNapoli24. ‘The problem is that Italian clubs don’t take advantage of opportunities, like Milan with Enzo Fernandez, who is now worth over 100 million. ‘When you arrive in time on a player you have to sink the shot, otherwise the prices change.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
