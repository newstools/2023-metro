It seems like everybody is nursing a cold or flu at the moment, with winter weather and a festive season of overindulgence taking their toll. When you’re ill, the best way to recuperate is to relax and keep yourself hydrated, which infused drinks like hot toddies are perfect for. Slow Cooker Recipe and Tips on Facebook recently shared their recipe for a comforting brew that’ll warm your cockles when you’re under the weather. And to save yourself the hassle of getting up to put the kettle on whenever you need a pick-me-up, you can even prepare batches in your slow cooker. The food blogger, who has over 900,000 followers, explained: ‘Soooo the household is as sick as a dog so in my slow cooker on low all day.’ Alongside a photo of their concoction, they also posted the recipe, which has garnered 6,300 likes and over 3,200 shares from fans. ‘What a fab idea,’ said one commenter, while another added: ‘I’m going to do this first thing in the morning! Thank you!’ So if you’re in the same boat, why not give it a go? Give your halved lemons a quick squeeze to allow the juice to escape. Add lemons, ginger, honey, and vinegar to the slow cooker. Fill up the pot with water and give the mixture a good stir to ensure no honey is stuck to the bottom. Set your slow cooker to ‘low’. Leave all day and, as the original poster says, ‘help yourself as you die on the couch.’ Some Facebook commenters recommended adding a dash of whisky or rum to your cup if you want to level up the warming qualities, although this is totally optional. As an extra bonus, your homemade healing drink will make your space smell amazing too. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
