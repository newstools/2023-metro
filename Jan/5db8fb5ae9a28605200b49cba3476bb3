EastEnders has warned that Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) faces a ‘bleak’ future now that her beloved Mick (Danny Dyer) has gone. With her husband missing and feared dead, Linda is left behind to pick up the pieces, and she is not coping well. With kids to look out for, fears grow as she spirals out of control and it’s clear that she is not coping at all. According to the soap, things are only set to get worse for her as time goes on. ‘The devastation of Mick’s tragic disappearance leaves broken Linda floundering,’ an EastEnders spokesperson explained. ‘Without her true love by her side, Linda’s future looks bleak – and she’s unsure how to carry on. ‘Confronted with the ghosts of her past, can Linda rebuild her life without Mick? ‘With Ollie and Annie in desperate need of their mother, Linda will need to muster all the strength she can find. But does she have it in her?’ Only time will tell, but we have seen what can happen when Linda hits rock bottom, and it is damaging for herself and others. And it’s not just Linda who is missing Mick. ‘There were lots of tears on and off screen from me!’ Kellie told us recently. ‘I’m terrible at goodbyes anyway, and I hate change. ‘It does feel like a massive end of an era. To have someone in your life on a daily basis for nine years and then to have to say goodbye to them is tough. ‘I still speak to Danny all the time, and I’ll still see him, but it won’t be the same. ‘It wasn’t until Danny’s leaving party, where they put together a montage of his best bits, and there was so much in it, that it hit me. ‘There was stuff we’d forgotten about, and it was such a reminder of the stuff that we’ve done together. It was amazing to see, we told so many stories, and we were such a team. ‘One of the hardest things I’ve found this year was Mick and Linda being split up. I’d have loved more Mick and Linda together.’ Judging by how her 2023 starts, we reckon Linda agrees whole-heartedly.
