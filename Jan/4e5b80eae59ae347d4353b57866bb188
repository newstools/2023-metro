Jacob Rees-Mogg is getting his own show on GB News after playing a prominent role in two failed governments. The Tory MP, known for his loyal support of Boris Johnson, double-breasted suits and falling asleep in the Commons, will join the likes of Nigel Farage and Eamonn Holmes on the TV channel. GB News said his show will ‘debate the hot topics of the day’ and feature guests from ‘across the political spectrum’. The Brexiteer, who was Business Secretary under Liz Truss and Leader of the House of Commons under Mr Johnson, will also take his new show on tour, broadcasting in front of live audiences in towns and cities across the country. He said: ‘GB News is a bastion of free speech which clearly has its finger uniquely on the pulse of public opinion and does not talk down to its viewers and listeners. ‘I have been impressed by the channel’s independent-mindedness and its determination to talk to people with many different perspectives, which is exactly what I will do on my programme.’ Mr Rees-Mogg resigned from the Cabinet in October after conceding he would not get a job in Rishi Sunak’s government. Editorial director of GB News Mick Booker said: ‘Jacob is an authentic and authoritative voice of the Tory backbenches with his trademark common sense, refreshing directness, and an impish sense of fun. ‘He’s a terrific addition to the GB News family. The programme will embrace a range of guests and viewpoints from all sides of politics but will also explore some of Jacob’s other wide-ranging interests. ‘No doubt classic cars and good Somerset cider will feature at some point.’ GB News was set up in June 2021, with former BBC heavyweight Andrew Neil positioned as chairman and host before he stepped down a few months later, calling the channel a ‘disaster’.
