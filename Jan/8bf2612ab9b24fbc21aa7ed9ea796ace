Emma Raducanu has slammed the ‘very slippery’ tennis courts at the ASB Classic after she suffered an ankle injury ahead of the 2023 Australian Open. The British No.1 left the court in tears as she was forced to retire from her second-round match against Viktoria Kuzmova in Auckland. With the Australian Open just 11 days away, it is unclear if she will even be able to play in the first major of the year in a what is undoubtedly a massive blow. Raducanu stunned the tennis world in 2021 when she won the US Open as a qualifier but massively struggled in 2022 with problems over form and injury. The 20-year-old slipped down to world No.78 in the WTA rankings but appeared to have turned a corner after she announced she was working with a new coach in Sebastian Sachs as well as Andy Murray’s former trainer Jez Green. But with a fresh setback so early into her 2023 campaign, Raducanu was understandably upset as she aimed a dig at the ASB Classic’s courts. ‘It’s difficult to take,’ Raducanu said. ‘I’ve put a lot of physical work in the last few months and I’ve been feeling good and optimistic. ‘So to be stopped by a freak injury, rolling an ankle is pretty disappointing, in the first week as well. I thought I was playing some pretty decent tennis. ‘The courts are incredibly slick, like very slippery, so to be honest it’s not a surprise that this happened to someone. ‘It’s out of my control and after a very long day of waiting around. But we’ll assess over the next few days and see what the next steps are.’ Raducanu ended her 2022 season early after suffering a wrist injury in October, but had started 2023 by rallying for a 4-6 6-4 6-2 victory over emerging Czech talent Linda Fruhvirtova, 17, on Tuesday.
