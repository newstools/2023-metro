Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi has turned down a move to Arsenal despite the Gunners being ready to trigger his €60 million (£52.6m) release clause, according to reports in Spain. Mikel Arteta is looking to reinforce his midfield options in the January transfer window and the Premier League leaders have already completed a £27m deal with Brighton for Leandro Trossard this week. However, the Premier League leaders are looking to bolster Arteta’s squad even further before the end of the window and an approach for Zubimendi has been made. According to Cadena SER, Arsenal have indicated to Real Sociedad that they are prepared to activate Zubimendi’s €60m (£52.6m) release clause this month. However, the report claims that the the 23-year-old has rejected a switch to Arsenal as he wants to finish the season with Real Sociedad. Zubimendi signed a new contract with Real Sociedad last October which keeps him tied to the La Liga club until 2027. The midfielder has also been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona at the end of the season. Real Sociedad had attempted to raise Zubimendi’s release clause to €90m (£79m) but the midfielder was happy not to increase it. ‘When the market opens, it’s normal for there to be rumours, they’re always there, but I’m lucky to be surrounded by good people who make me focus on La Real and I don’t want to waste energy on other things, I’m clear about what I want for this year and it is Real,’ Zubimendi said when asked about his future last month. ‘The clause did not go up. The truth is that it is a subject that surprised me, because I was very happy for having renewed and I saw that there were many comments about the clause not having gone up. ‘It is a figure that, compared with other players, I thought was balanced, what it should be.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
