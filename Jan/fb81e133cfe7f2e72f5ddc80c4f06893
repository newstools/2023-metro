A bus has plunged off a cliff in northern Peru, killing at least 25 people. Shocking pictures show the bus on its side, surrounded by the bodies of passengers who were hurled through the windows. The bus belonged to Q’orianka Tours and was heading from the capital Lima to the Tumbes region, near the Ecuador border in Peru’s coastal desert. It’s not known what caused the crash but the bus fell many metres down the rocky slope into a ravine in the early hours. Injured survivors from the bus, believed to be carrying around 60 passengers, were taken to nearby hospitals. Police are now investigating what made the driver veer off the road.
