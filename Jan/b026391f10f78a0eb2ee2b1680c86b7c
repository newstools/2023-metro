A man has been charged following the death of Elle Edwards, who was shot at a pub in Wallasey, Merseyside, on Christmas Eve. The 26-year-old beautician had been out with her sister and friends when she was killed just before midnight. Connor Chapman, 22, has been charged with her murder, Merseyside Police said. He has been remanded in custody to appear at Wirral Adult Remand Court on Friday. Chapman, of Houghton Road, Woodchurch, has also been charged with: two counts of attempted murder, three counts of unlawful and malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life and handling stolen goods. A 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has been released on bail pending further enquiries, police said. Elle’s father, Tim Edwards, read out a statement on behalf of the family at a press conference by Merseyside Police five days after the murder. He said: ‘There was no one as beautiful as our Elle May, her looks, her laugh and the way she would light up a room as soon as she walked in. ‘She had this way about her that as soon as you met her, you just instantly fell in love with her, everyone that met Elle knew how special she was. ‘She was only just getting started. ‘Christmas and our family will never be the same again without her. She was the glue that held this big family together, from all of us.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
