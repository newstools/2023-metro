Now that the festive season is over, up and down the nation people are throwing their Christmas trees away. But it seems we’re all missing a trick by not giving our trees away to llamas and alpacas instead. Alpacas and llamas like to nibble on hedgerows, but they’re pretty sparse in winter, so these abundant festive trees make for a tasty alternative. When Mary Harvey took to social media to ask for Christmas trees to feed to her animals, she was absolutely inundated with festive greenery. Mary, who runs CHAT – Chy Lowen Alpacas Tregaswith, in Cornwall – explained that the camelids ‘love’ the trees as a post-festive season snack. One tree is usually able to last around a week with the animals. But Mary – whose non-profit organisation aims to help children and young adults with a variety of issues using animal-assisted intervention (AAI) – has been given enough to last her animals an impressive three months. Adorable footage shows one of them, Dusk, happily chowing down on one of the donated Christmas trees. Christmas trees – which are usually pine, spruce or fir – are a great source of vitamin C and antioxidants for the llamas and alpacas. So not only are they tasty for them, but the trees also make for great dietary supplements. Do you have a story to share?
