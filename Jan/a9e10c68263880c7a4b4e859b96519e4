Gabriel Martinelli is set to sign a huge contract extension with Arsenal according to reports – ending speculation about his future. The star forward’s current deal is set to expire in 2024, though the Gunners did have the option to extend it by another two years. Given the Brazil international’s incredible form this season, there had been talk that several European giants were preparing to make a move for the 21-year-old, including Barcelona. But all that will be put to bed very soon, with The Athletic reporting that Martinelli has agreed to fresh terms with Arsenal and will pen a new contract that will keep him at the Emirates until 2027. Signed by Unai Emery back in 2019, Martinelli has developed into an integral part of Mikel Arteta’s side this season, aiding the Gunners in their title charge. So far this campaign, he’s scored seven goals and made two assists in 19 league appearances. Arsenal are currently top of Premier League table, five points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand over the Citizens. On Friday night, the Gunners travel to the Etihad for their FA Cup fourth round clash against Pep Gaurdiola’s side. And despite being a near ever-present for his team, Martinelli has been benched for the game, with January signing Leandro Trossard talking his place on the left-wing. This marks the Belgian’s full debut for the club following his £20million move from Brighton.
