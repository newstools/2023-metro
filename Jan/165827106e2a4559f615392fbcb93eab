A 17-year-old boy has been arrested after four spectators at a car meet were injured by a convertible which veered off the road. Footage appears to show a blue Mazda MX5 drifting round a roundabout lined with people in Portsmouth on Saturday night. The driver appears to lose control at the end of the manoeuvre and hurtles towards onlookers on the pavement. A teenage girl and a woman in her 20s were seriously hurt while two others suffered minor injuries. One of the female victims remains in hospital in a stable condition. Around 40 or 50 cars had gathered at the meet in Portfield Road, with detectives urging witnesses to come forward. Hampshire Police said: ‘We have already received a number of submissions from people, and all available footage will assist with our inquiries, whether this is dashcam footage, mobile phone video or anything else. ‘It is important to remember vehicles being driven in an anti-social manner, especially where there is a large gathering of people and vehicles, is a risk to public safety.’ The teenage suspect was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. It comes just over a week after a 16-year-old girl was seriously injured at a car meet in a Morrisons car park in Waterlooville, Hampshire. She was found with a badly damaged knee after police received reports that a Fiat 500 had hit spectators. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
