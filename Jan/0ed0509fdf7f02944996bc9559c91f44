A TikTok user has gone viral for showing off a nifty hack to get more from your prawn cracker – a beloved part of any Chinese takeaway. Chloe Lewis (@chloe_lewis97) blew social media away after sharing her viral video, with one user in awe saying that she ‘invented’ this new technique. The mind-blowing video has been viewed by more than eight million people – who are now dying to order a takeaway to have a go. In the video, she gets a prawn cracker from the bag and presses it into some rice. Chloe then holds it in that position for a few seconds before gripping the prawn cracker and lifting it up. This leaves her prawn cracker with a mouth-watering stack of rice piled on top. Social media users were left speechless and shocked at the realisation – with some wondering why they didn’t think of it in the first place. ‘My jaw just dropped! No more scooping for me,’ one person says. Another person shared their frustration at having to wait for another month to try the hack – because they recently had a Chinese takeaway. Whereas someone else shared how they already tried this out – but suggests putting noodles on top for maximum flavour. ‘It’s so nice,’ the user said. Do you have a story to share?
