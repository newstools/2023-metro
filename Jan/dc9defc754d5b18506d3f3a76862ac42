Lip gloss nails are exactly what they sound like, offering a subtle change without much effort. Think of the effect a slick of lacquer gives to your lips: glowy and shiny, with a whisper of colour. This is the same. A toned down version of the glazed doughnut trend, lip gloss nails have far less steps to getting the look – and you only need one product, so it’s easy to do at home on the cheap. To gloss up your mani, start with clean nails. You may also want to push back cuticles and trim hangnails for a more salon-fresh result. Next, take a sheer polish with or without sparkles (we’ve found both options to make the job easier) and apply one to two coats – just make sure you can still see your natural nail through the polish. What you’re left with is a ‘your nails but better’ look, that can serve well in between gel appointments and help hide any stains or damage, while still appearing fairly natural. We’ve picked some of our favourite polishes to achieve the look – from milky shades to light reflecting shimmers. Do you have a story to share?
