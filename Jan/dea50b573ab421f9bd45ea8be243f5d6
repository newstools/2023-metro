King Charles looked in high spirits as he and Queen Consort Camilla attended the New Year’s Day service at Sandringham this morning. The couple greeted crowds of well-wishers outside the Church of St Mary Magdalene today – with just over a week until Prince Harry’s new tell-all book drops. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh used to visit the church with other members of the family on the first day of the year. But the tradition was sidelined as the Covid pandemic hit and Her Majesty’s health declined. The King, 74, looked happy to revive the tradition today, while wearing a tweed coat, brown shoes and a patterned tie. Camilla, 75, wore a dark coat with a brooch and waved to people who had gathered to see them. Last year was a life-changing one for the royal pair as Charles lost his mother and took the British throne. They also dealt with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s controversial Netflix documentary and Prince Andrew’s out-of-court settlement with accuser Virginia Giuffre. The Duke of York has repeatedly denied sexually assaulting Ms Giuffre when she was a teenager. The New Year could bring fresh turbulence for the Royal Family as Prince Harry releases Spare. Described as ‘full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief’, it will hit shelves on January 10. It was previously reported that the royal household is bracing itself for the memoir, amid fears that it could be ‘critical of everyone and everything’. But reports today claim it will be ‘tough on Prince William’ but Charles will come out better than expected. Meghan Markle is also thought to be considering writing her own memoir. The Duchess of Sussex is ‘contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the Royal limelight… and leaving no stone unturned’.
