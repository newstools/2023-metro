Emergency crews had to smash down the wall of a flat during a 17-hour bid to rescue a 47-stone heart attack victim. Firefighters, paramedics and police officers worked together to help bring the man down from his first-floor council flat in Acton, west London. Medics were called at around 2am on Friday, and after being treated in his bed at home they had to call for further assistance to help get him out. At around 9am fire crews had to knock down an outside wall, and they then built a plywood ramp and used ropes to hoist him onto a stretcher. He was finally wheeled into an ambulance at around 8pm, before he was taken to a special ward at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington. One neighbour told The Sun how the man is said to live on takeaway deliveries. Vernon Bannister, 74, said: ‘Last time I went in he had the biggest TV I have ever seen. ‘This is the third time they’ve tried to take him — the last time the bed broke. ‘Now they’ve had to take half the building apart. ‘There’s other people in this building that are sick and they have to pay for it.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
