Among the cool new tech unveiled at CES 2023, one device claims to answer a question that drives most parents nuts: ‘Why is my baby crying?’ The Q-bear calls itself an ‘AI Baby Crying Translator’ that can analyze and recognize babies’ needs from different types of cries to help parents react more easily. The device, created by a Taiwanese company, can differentiate between babies’ cries for hunger, a wet diaper, sleepiness or a need for comfort. According to the website, Q-bear can also ‘detect a baby’s discomfort level for parents to further understand their baby’s health situation’. The soft silicone-covered device can be fitted in a crib or stroller and uses patented tech to analyze a baby’s cries to determine one of four needs from its ‘discomfort index’. Q-bear’s translation comes within 10 seconds of a baby crying. The device can also record babies’ health details, detect how sleepy or comfortable a baby is and it can automatically play soothing music. For example, it can automatically play a lullaby or a ‘patented womb sound’ and switch on a sleep aid light if the baby’s cry is determined to indicate tiredness. Parents can also upload audiobooks, music or even record and upload their own voices for the device to use. Q-bear’s makers say it is designed using an 18-layer deep learning architecture and processes GPU pre-training mode through more than 10,000 rows of crying data from babies. The device notifies parents about the baby crying, an abnormal indoor temperature or humidity reading, abnormal urine frequency, or an abnormal pain index. The device claims to be ‘the most accurate’ (95%) prediction product on the market, while its learning function can further increase the accuracy with the number of uses.
