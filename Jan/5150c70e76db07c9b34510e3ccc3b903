 A Maserati driver was double the drink-drive limit when he smashed the supercar into railings – right in front of police. Council CCTV footage shows the luxury vehicle swerve to the right before colliding with a traffic light and rails on the central pedestrian reservation in Birmingham city centre. Unfortunately for the motorist, a police car was waiting to turn right at the lights, at the junction of Bristol Street and Bristol Road. The video shows smoke pouring out of the Maserati and debris flying after the crash. Police bodycam footage showed how the damaged island railings had been torn down by the impact of the collision. The driver was breathalysed and found to be twice the legal limit after the incident on October 2 last year, West Midlands Police said. He was later handed a 12-month driving ban and fined almost £2,200. The West Midlands Police Traffic Unit posted the footage on Twitter along with the caption: ‘This clip shows the dangers of drink driving. ‘The driver of this Maserati was double the limit when he crashed in front of one of our patrols and was arrested,’ the tweet added. ‘He was found guilty and was banned from driving for a year and fined a total of £2,190.’ A learner driver saw his dream £100,000 gold-plated Maserati towed away by police because it was not insured. Another motorist was arrested for sending his supercar careering down Rome’s famous Spanish steps after ‘following his sat nav’, his lawyer said.
