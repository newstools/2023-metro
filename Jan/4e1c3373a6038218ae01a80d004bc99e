A naughty dog left her owner in shock when she fetched something slightly more risqué than a stick. Manuel Barcia, 50, was recently out for a pleasant walk in the park with Ahsoka the Golden Retriever. The pup ran off into some long grass, clearly on the scent of something interesting. When the 15-month old dog came running back it wasn’t a stick she was carrying, but a massive vibrating dildo. Manuel, from Leeds, could not stop laughing for at least five minutes, and soon struggled to prise the sex toy from Ahsoka’s mouth. ‘She’s always carrying a stick, or something similar. Being a retriever she always brings sticks back, or rocks,’ he said. ‘I got the treats out and convinced her to put it down so I didn’t have to pick it up. Then I hooked her on her lead and we quickly left. ‘I guess it’s still there in the grass somewhere.’ Manuel said Ahsoka was pretty reluctant to leave the sex toy behind in the park. He continued: ‘She wasn’t too happy I made her leave it behind. She didn’t want to let it go. ‘I don’t take myself too seriously, I just found it hilarious. I think I put my back out laughing.’ Ahsoka is not the only cheeky dog to be making the headlines in recent weeks. Posey the dog ended up on Santa’s naughty list after she gobbled up an entire Elf on the Shelf toy and she left the two children in the house distraught. The footage which was shared on TikTok shows the last scraps of flour, a guilty-looking, flour-covered Posey, and the two children both in tears. Thankfully, grandma was able to swoop in to the rescue with a replacement doll. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
