In need of a little January pick-me-up? A collection of baby animals photos have just been released and the snaps are the ultimate mood boost. Photographers from all over the world captured these adorable shots of the ‘cutest animal babies’ from 2022, collated by Media Drum, including a shy orangutan and a tiger cub relaxing. Others show two little elephants playing as well as some teeny tiny polar bears. Photographer Hao Jiang, who captured the cubs, said: ‘These twin polar bear cubs were only around three months old and weighed 20 to 30 pounds and had just emerged from their maternity den a few days ago.’ There’s also a zebra with a rare condition causing abnormalities in stripe patterns.
