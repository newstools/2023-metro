Wout Weghorst was absent from Besiktas training on Wednesday, citing ‘groin pain’ as he attempts to force through a move to Manchester United. The Dutchman is desperate to move to Old Trafford but Besiktas are awaiting a satisfactory compensation package from Burnley before they agree to terminate his season-long loan deal in Istanbul. The 30-year-old angered club officials by appearing to wave goodbye to supporters during a league match on Saturday and they’ve since released a statement to deny reports that there’s a clause in Weghorst’s contract for him to be recalled. Nevertheless, Burnley have accepted United’s proposal to take Weghorst on loan for the remainder of the season and the Turks are simply waiting to sign a replacement before they release the Netherlands international. Weghorst, understandably, does not want to put his dream move in jeopardy and he failed to train with the first team today. The Dutchman cited pain in his groin area and instead trained alone in the club gym, according to Turkish outlet Fanatik. United must register Weghorst before midday on Friday if the Dutchman is to make his debut in the Manchester derby 24 hours later at Old Trafford. Ten Hag was questioned on United’s interest in Weghorst after the side’s 3-0 Carabao Cup quarter-final win against Charlton on Tuesday. However, the Dutchman refused to disclose if a deal was close. Asked if he could give an update, Ten Hag said: ‘No, unfortunately I can’t.’ MORE : ‘He’ll be joining’ – Bacary Sagna insists Arsenal will complete deal to sign Mykhailo Mudryk this month MORE : Besiktas president explains Wout Weghorst delay after Manchester United agree fee For more stories like this, check our sport page.
