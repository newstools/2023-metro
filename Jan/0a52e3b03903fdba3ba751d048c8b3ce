A woman was sent horrific racist messages from a man she matched with on the dating app Bumble. Sophie Harrison, 30, talked to the man who has not been named for three weeks on the app and experienced no problems. But when the conversation moved over to WhatsApp he decided to send a message saying it was ‘disgusting’ her ex had been a black man. Things escalated when the pair became friends on Facebook and the man saw a picture of Sophie’s ex. The accountant from Manchester said: ‘He said he couldn’t imagine his girlfriend having had sex with one of ‘them’ and that apparently any white lad hates the “thought of his misses with some black c**t”. ‘When I heard that I felt instantly sick. It was disgusting.’ She saved screenshots of the conversation which say: ‘Not being funny at all but I did nosy at your photos – your ex is a black lad… you sure I’m your type?’ He goes on to ask: ‘Is he the only one or have you had more of them?’ Adding: ‘I just find it off putting and a bit disgusting to be frank. ‘Also you blanked how you obviously find them lot attractive so I’d be wondering every time one was about.’ Sophie then told him the comments were out of order before ending the online conversation. She says she’s been left ‘unsettled’ by the interaction and the man in his 30s has not messaged her since. ‘To see it so prevalent in my generation is seriously worrying – it was a very unsettling experience,’ she said. ‘I’m still using dating apps, but it has made me very wary about who I speak to going forward.’ Bumble has been contacted for comment by Metro.co.uk.
