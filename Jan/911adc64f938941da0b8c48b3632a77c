The Love Island contestants are going to welcome another bombshell to the villa in Sunday’s installment, but who’s toes will she be stepping on? Fans have been witnessing a lot of drama in the last few episodes, as well as the arrival of newcomers Ellie Spence and Spencer Wilks. And it looks like the stars are in for another surprise as Samie Elishi enters the villa. As the islanders get dressed up for the night, the boys receive a text that sparks some excitement. ‘Boys, grab a drink and head to the sundeck to meet Samie #HappyHour #GetOnJob,’ the text reads. Hearing the squeals from their dressing room, Jessie Wynter asks: ‘What are they doing?’ Lana Jenkins questions: ‘What’s going on? What if they’ve got a text?’ Well, the girls might want to look away because cue in senior estate agent coordinator Samie. When asked about what she’ll bring to the show, she said: ‘Honesty. I’m a really honest person and I have no filter. I won’t take rubbish from anyone, especially when it comes to guys!’ But the question is, who has she got her eye on? Sunday’s teaser will also document the aftermath of Friday’s brutal dares game which saw Zara Lackenby-Brown furious over Tom Clare’s face, body, personality admission. When the girls ask if she’s okay, she replied: ‘No I just can’t be arsed.’ ‘He’s picking Liv’s [Olivia Hawkins] face, I’m not just f*****g booty to you. If you don’t like me, move from me,’ she seethed. Love Island returns tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
