A driver was pulled over on the motorway only for cops to discover he had just been banned and was on his way back home from court. Police stopped the 30-year-old, who was wearing a suit, for driving suspiciously slow on the M20 near Ashford in Kent last Tuesday. It then emerged he had appeared at Folkestone magistrates hours earlier, where he was banned for four months after driving with an expired licence and no insurance. Officers duly arrested him and impounded his car. Kent Police’s road unit tweeted: ‘We noted this vehicle on the M20 towards Ashford travelling slowly. ‘Checks showed a female insured only. Vehicle stopped and male driver in his best suit had literally left court after being disqualified. ‘Vehicle seized and driver back at court shortly.’ A spokesperson added: ‘The man had been disqualified from driving for four months at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court on 3 January after admitting driving without insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
