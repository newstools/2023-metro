A person has been left with life-changing injuries after unknowingly eating a sweet laced with synthetic cannabis. Two people fell ill at a Christmas party at Aubrey Park Hotel, in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Police said the pair were reportedly offered some sweets, which later caused them to have bad reactions and require hospital treatment. One victim has been left with life changing injuries, due to the reaction the drug caused, while the second experienced minor illness. It was later discovered – unknown to them – that the sweets contained synthetic cannabis. A woman, from St Albans, has since been arrested on suspicion of administering a noxious substance. The 34-year-old is currently in police custody over the incident, which took place on December 10. Constable C-Jay Callaghan, who is investigating, said: ‘I would like to reassure the community that this was an isolated incident involving people who are believed to be known to each other. ‘We are following up all lines of enquiry and would therefore like to hear from anyone who may have attended the event and witnessed what happened.’ Both cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids – commonly referred to as Spice – are illegal to produce possess, distribute or sell in the UK. Experts have previously warned the widespread use in the country has become an ‘epidemic’. Because synthetic cannabinoids are more potent, it is easy to use too much and experience unpleasant and harmful effects. Some side effects may include mood swings, nausea, feelings of lightheadedness and dizziness, hot flushes, increased heart rate and blood pressure, seizures and fits.
