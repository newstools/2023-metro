King Charles has barely been on the throne for three months, and has had to deal with a number of embarrassing to the monarchy incidents. First, there were anti-royalists throwing eggs at His Majesty, then rumours he had ‘thrown Prince Andrew out of Buckingham Palace’. Now, the monarch is having to face claims in Prince Harry’s autobiography, Spare, about himself and the new heir to the throne, Prince William, and how the Royal Family treated Meghan Markle. How he handles the fallout will likely shape the future of the monarchy, and, even determine whether it has one at all. The king was spotted for the first time on Thursday as his car passed through the gates of Sandringham House. He was again pictured today as further details emerged about a bust-up between his two sons about the Sussexes interview with Oprah Winfrey. Charles attended the Sunday Service at St Lawrence’s Church in Ingworth, Norfolk, ignoring the latest round of bombshell leaks from Spare. He was seen smiling and chatting with delighted well-wishers after this morning’s church service. He has been staying at the Norfolk estate over the festive period, and has so far remained silent over his younger son’s claims. Charles is also featured in a number of the extracts, including some of the most shocking ones. He reportedly told both Harry and William ‘not to make his final years a misery’ through fighting. Buckingham Palace is yet to make a comment on any of the allegations in Spare, which is being released on Tuesday. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
