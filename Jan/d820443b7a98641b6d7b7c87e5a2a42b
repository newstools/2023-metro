A Ryanair flight from Poland was escorted by fighter jets to Athens following a bomb threat. The flight FR6385 from Katowice in Poland landed in El. Venizelos, Greece earlier this evening. The Boeing 737-800 was seen parked in a remote area of the airport after the pilot reported a serious threat during the flight. An airport spokesperson said ‘all people are well and safe’ AirLive has reported. Hungarian fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the plane until it reached North Macedonia. Then F-16 fight jets from Hellenic Air Force escorted the airliner until it landed in Athens. Police and firefighters surrounded the plane after it landed at a remote spot at the airport and was inspected by the bomb squad, ANA, a Greek news agency, reported. Passengers were taken off the plane and searched, as well as their luggage and the aircraft itself. The Greek fighter jets intercepted the plane as it entered Greek airspace above North Macedonia, the Greek Defence Ministry said. It is unclear where the origin of the bomb threat came from but it is thought to have been made shortly after the plane left Poland. RyanAir has been contacted for comment. Got a story?
