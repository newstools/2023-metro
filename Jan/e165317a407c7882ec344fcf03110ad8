A nightclub where a footballer was stabbed to death on Boxing Day will shut for good for exposing people to ‘terrifying risks’. Cody Fisher, 23, had been on a night out at Crane in Digbeth, Birmingham, when he was approached by a group of people and knifed on the dancefloor. Emergency services rushed to the venue but he was declared dead around half an hour later. People who attended the festive party criticised the security searches and recalled a ‘moody’ atmosphere inside. Birmingham City Council has now permanently removed the nightclub’s operating licence. Initially, Crane was closed for 28 days after an interim meeting held in December. But authorities have today ordered the licence to be revoked, after an application by the police force. West Midlands Police said the club’s ongoing operation posed ‘terrifying risks’ to customers. They detailed ‘blatant’ and widespread drug use, and ‘inadequate’ security, which had also allowed a knife to be brought inside. The force previously said there had been ‘serious management failings’. Three men, aged between 18 and 22, have been charged with Mr Fisher’s murder. They have been remanded into custody awaiting trial, set to be held in July. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
