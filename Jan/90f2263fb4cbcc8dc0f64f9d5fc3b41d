Border Force officers at Heathrow Airport have seized material contaminated with uranium, it has been reported. Counter-terrorism is said to be investigating the incident after a package coming into the UK was found with traces of the radioactive element. It was discovered by officers on December 29, and after being assessed it was said to be ‘posing no threat to the public’. Uranium is a radioactive metal central to one of the most devastating acts of war in history, and was used in the bombing of Hiroshima in Japan in 1945. Uranium is naturally radioactive: Its nucleus is unstable, so the element is in a constant state of decay, seeking a more stable arrangement. Scotland Yard said: ‘We can confirm officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command were contacted by Border Force colleagues at Heathrow after a very small amount of contaminated material was identified after routine screening within a package incoming to the UK on December 29, 2022.’ Commander Richard Smith said: ‘I want to reassure the public that the amount of contaminated material was extremely small and has been assessed by experts as posing no threat to the public. ‘Although our investigation remains ongoing, from our inquiries so far, it does not appear to be linked to any direct threat. ‘As the public would expect, however, we will continue to follow up on all available lines of inquiry to ensure this is definitely the case.’ The force said the material has been identified as being contaminated with uranium, no arrests have been made and officers are working with partner agencies to investigate and ensure there is no risk to the public.
