A pregnant woman who was heading to a birthday party was shot dead in what is suspected to be a targeted drive-by shooting. Marissa Perez, 25, was sitting in the passenger’s seat of a car as her father was driving to pick up a birthday cake when the shooting occurred around 7.30pm Thursday. She was due to give birth in six months. ‘Marissa was the most loving daughter, sister, cousin and friend. Marissa was expecting the biggest blessing, a baby in June,’ states a GoFundMe page set up for her. ‘Anyone who knew Marissa knew she was the most loyal, loving, outgoing, and strongest person.’ A driver pulled up next to Perez and her father at the intersection of Artesia and Pioneer boulevards in Artesia, California, and fired into their vehicle, her mother Sandra Tolentino told KABC. Perez was struck multiple times, including once in the head. She was transported to a hospital, where she and her unborn child were pronounced dead. Perez’s family said investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department believe the shooting was targeted, but did not immediately have a possible motive. ‘It wasn’t random,’ Tolentino said. ‘We know that. It was not random.’ The suspects or suspects remain at large and no description has been released a week after the attack. ‘She was 25. She was about to be a mother in five more months. She was so happy,’ Tolentino told the TV station. ‘She always cared for so many people. Her heart was literally on her sleeve every day.’ Perez’s family has appealed to the public for tips on the case. ‘She was so excited, she seemed like a while new person,’ Perez’s brother Isaac Tolentino told KTLA about her pregnancy. ‘I’ve never seen my sister glow like that.’ The GoFundMe had raised more than $31,000 as of Thursday afternoon. Anyone with information on the incident is urged to contact the sheriff’s department. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
