This is the aftermath of a suspected gas explosion in East Yorkshire that has left a man homeless. Footage shows the devastation in the port town of Goole, which was likened to ‘a scene from the Blitz’. Families were forced to take shelter in the parish church in the early hours of this morning. Police and firefighters rushed to Marlborough Avenue after the explosion ripped through one of the terraced houses. They can be seen clearing out the wreckage, while police vans block both ends of the street. A video shows the gaping hole in the property where the blast blew out the entire upper floor. Lidija Jeremejeva, who lives across the street, said: ‘Right now everyone is gone except the workers who cleaned the ruins and the police control blocking half of the street from the roundabout to the middle of the street.’ Meanwhile, another person who witnessed the incident, said the whole street was evacuated to nearby church. It is yet unconfirmed if the explosion was caused by a gas leak, and if anyone was injured. Metro.co.uk has contacted Humberside Police for a further comment.
