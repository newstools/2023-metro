Fancy buying your own boozer? A new map shows the 35 Wetherspoons pubs up for grabs across the country. In September, the company announced it was selling off a slew of pubs as it battled a lack of staff and rising costs. The UK and Ireland pub chain, owned by Tim Martin, made the ‘commercial decision’ to sell. It comes amid warnings the company could lose up to £30 million due to upkeep and wages. Spoons spokesman Eddie Gershon previously said: ‘On occasion, Wetherspoon does put some of its pubs up for sale. This is a commercial decision. ‘We understand that customers and staff will be disappointed with it. The pubs will continue to operate as Wetherspoon outlets until they are sold.’ The pub giant has now sold 10 of its sites and another 35 are also on the market, Devon Live reports. A Wetherspoon spokesperson said: ‘Wetherspoon still has a number of pubs for sale. They will continue to trade as Wetherspoon pubs until they are sold.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
