Manchester United have reached a verbal agreement to sign Wout Weghorst on loan, according to reports. The Netherlands international is currently on loan at Besiktas from Burnley and the Turkish club have been adamant that the striker will remain with them until the end of the season. United are in the market for a new striker after deciding to terminate Cristiano Ronaldo’s contract during the World Cup but their options are limited in the January transfer window. According to The Guardian, United have agreed to pay Besiktas around €3m (£2.7m) in order for them to end their loan agreement with Burnley. The report claims that Besiktas will only give the green light once they have signed a replacement for Weghorst. The 30-year-old was signed by Burnley in a £12m deal from Wolfsburg last January but he managed just two goals in 20 Premier League appearances before he joined Besiktas on loan last summer. Weghorst has fared better during his time in the Turkish top flight, scoring eight goals in 16 games for Besiktas. At the World Cup in Qatar, Weghorst made four appearances off the bench and scored two late goals for Netherlands against Argentina to force extra time in their quarter-final defeat.
