A man who vowed to squat in an old cinema for ‘as long as it takes’ ended his protest after just a few hours. Nick Haskins is determined to save the Broadway Cinema in Bristol from demolition. So much so, that he made plans to set up shop in the crumbling building. Nick began a squatting at 11am on Monday morning but voluntarily left by 6.15pm. He also popped out for a cake during the sit-in protest. Nick hasn’t completely given up hope, but has instead simply readjusted his battle plans. The 61-year-old told Bristol24: ’There’s no point in me going in there and sitting in a building that ain’t going down yet,” explained Nick, whose grandfather helped build the cinema. ‘When it really counts is when the bulldozers go in, because that will be costing them God knows how much. ‘I’ve put the awareness out there that I’ve been in there and I will be back. I got the security sussed, I’ll be in there no problem.’ Nick was told in a recent planning committee meeting that the Broadway Cinema cannot be saved from demolition. He has demanded a formal apology from Bristol City Council over the decision. Demolition at the site is due to begin in February. The Broadway Cinema is located in the Filwood Park-Knowle West district to the south of Bristol City Centre. It was opened in 1938 by Roy Chamberlain and had a 30 feet wide screen and equipped with a British Talking Pictures sound system. The property went through various refurbishments in the coming years – and it’s time as a cinema ended in 1971. It became a full-time bingo club until the site was closed in 1992 and been derelict ever since. Nick told Bristol24 the time ‘flew by’ during his morning protest – and that he even had time to pop out for a cake. He added: ‘It wasn’t too cold, it was nice. I had a little walk around and went on the roof and had a lie down in the sun.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
