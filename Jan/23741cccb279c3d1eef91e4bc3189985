Three people have died at a construction site after the scaffolding they were on collapsed. The workers died shortly after 9am on Monday in the industrial accident in Charlotte, North Carolina. Fire captain Jackie Gilmore said that they were pronounced dead at the scene while another two workers were taken to the Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center to be treated for minor injuries. Work at the site was halted following the 70ft fall so that the incident could be investigated. Footage from a news helicopter showed some of the scaffolding hanging at an angle from the building and a broken platform at the side of the structure. There was also scaffolding and wood strewn across the ground where it landed. A family reunification area was set up near the site. A luxury senior living complex is being built at the site where the workers fell, the Queen City News reported. However, the developer which is based in Houston, the Bridgewood Property Company, stated that the accident took place at a different address, according to NBC News. Officials did not confirm the name of the company operating the construction site. WCNC observed a sign at the site that read Hanover Company and said a person who answered an associated phone number said they would likely release a statement on Tuesday. A city petition linked to the site address from 2020 shows building plans for 350 multi-family units. Falls are the leading cause of death in the construction industry and there were about 1,000 such deaths in 2020, an OSHA Fall Prevention campaign website states.
