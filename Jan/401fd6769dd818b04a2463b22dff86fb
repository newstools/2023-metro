On a visit to Liverpool today, one of Kate Middleton’s favourite pieces made a reappearance, and we can see why it’s a wardrobe staple. The Prince and Princess of Wales are visiting the newly-opened Royal Liverpool University Hospital, meeting staff and touring the facilities. For the occasion, Kate donned a navy woollen dress and belt, with tonal navy shoes to compliment the look. The real showstopper, though, was her coat. From British designer Holland Cooper, the Black Watch Tartan coat features the checked pattern in dark blue and green, with statement gold buttons. In a longline, slightly relaxed shape, it’s double breasted and lined with satin. It’s also hand cut and made in England, using a mix of premium UK wools for an extra luxe feel. The Princess has sported the plaid piece a few times recently; while planting a tree in memory of Queen Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in December, and in a film about Remembrance alongside the Royal British Legion in 2021. And you can get your hands on it too – the coat is available for £749 on Holland Cooper’s website, with each being handmade to order and delivered to your door. That said, most of us don’t have the money to drop so much on a single item of clothing. But thankfully there are plenty of affordable alternatives on the high street. If you want to emulate Kate Middleton’s chic tartan vibe, these are the pieces to shop. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
