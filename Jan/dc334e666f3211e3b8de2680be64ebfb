Ghislaine Maxwell said she hopes the victims of her former friend Jeffrey Epstein ‘have some closure’, but added they should take out any anger over his death on the ‘authorities’. The former socialite, 61, is serving time in a US prison after being convicted of sex trafficking and grooming girls for Epstein. The billionaire paedophile was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 before his trial on sex abuse charges was due to begin, with the death ruled a suicide. In an interview with TalkTV, Maxwell said: ‘I would say Epstein died, and [the victims] should take their disappointment and their upset out on the authorities that allowed that to happen. ‘As I said, I hope they have some closure by the judicial process that took place.’ During her own trial in 2021, prosecutors described Maxwell and Epstein as ‘partners in crime’, with the socialite recruiting young girls for her once-boyfriend. Among the women who claimed they were trafficked by Maxwell was Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old. In a clip from the TalkTV interview released yesterday, Maxwell said a famous photograph showing the teenager with the Duke of York was faked. She said: ‘It’s a fake. I don’t believe it’s real for a second, in fact I’m sure it’s not.’ Andrew has also said he does not think the picture is genuine, claiming he is ‘not one to hug’ or ‘display affection’ in public. Ms Giuffre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts, said she gave the original photograph to the FBI in 2011. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in June last year and she is currently serving at Federal Correctional Institute Tallahassee in Florida. Andrew is said to have saved up a £10 million fund to launch a legal case against Virginia Giuffre when her gagging order ends in February.
