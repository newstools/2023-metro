Police rescued a man from an overturned patrol car seconds before it was hit by an oncoming train. Mickal Parker, 29, is accused of stealing the police car while an officer was speaking with a stopped motorist by the side of the road in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday. He then crashed and flipped the vehicle onto live train tracks. Body cam and helicopter footage showed police trying to free Parker from the smashed vehicle. Dramatic video shows them trying to drag him out of the wreckage just seconds before the train slammed into the car. Police said Parker was an ‘uninvolved subject’ in the traffic stop. He allegedly ‘entered the driver seat of the officer’s patrol car and fled the location’. The suspect was then taken into custody and charged with theft by taking, fleeing and eluding, reckless driving, obstruction, and damage to city property, according to the police. A City of Atlanta Police Department spokesperson said: ‘This incident is one that truly shows no traffic stop is routine. ‘The officers involved were quickly able to transition from traffic enforcement to stolen vehicle recovery and then transition again to preservation of life.’ It comes after in Colorado, a train hit a police car whilst a woman was handcuffed in the backseat. Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, 20, suffered multiple broken bones and a head injury when the freight train smashed into the vehicle on September 16 in Weld County, Colorado. Rios-Gonzalez was arrested in relation to a road rage incident involving a gun. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
