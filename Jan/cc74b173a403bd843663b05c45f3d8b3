These are not just strawberries. These are M&S, Collection White Pearl Strawberries. And they are dividing the internet. This week, Marks and Spencer announced the launch of ‘strawberries in reverse’, with the creation of a bizarre-looking white strawberry covered in tiny red seeds. The strawberries are apparently naturally bred, developed using seeds from Japanese white strawberries crossed with traditional red ones. The announcement gave shoppers a good laugh on Instagram and Twitter, with some even questioning whether this was simply an early April fools. So, what do these oh-so-odd looking berries actually smell and taste like? M&S says the strawberries have an aroma of pineapple and notes of vanilla, but as I munch a few at my desk, I have to disagree. From the outside, the strawberries smell like… well, strawberries. But when you bite into the pure white flesh, the scent is a little tangy. Honestly, it reminds me of a mild cheese. The taste is less disturbing, as is the texture. If I close my eyes, I could be eating a regular, red strawberry. But not the nicest one, it has to be said. Though they’re juicy enough, the flavour of these plump white berries is muted. If you were served these at Wimbledon, you’d say they weren’t quite ripe. I’m a big fan of some of the other M&S fruity hybrids (those candy floss grapes are a guilty pleasure). But at £4 a punnet, these white strawberries are a gimmick I won’t be eating twice. Sorry, M&S.
