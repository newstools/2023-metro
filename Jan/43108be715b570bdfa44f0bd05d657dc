A murder investigation has been launched after a 39-year-old woman was found dead in her home on New Year’s Eve. A man, 29, has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death in west London. The Metropolitan Police say they are ‘confident the woman is Stephanie Hansen’, although formal identification has yet to take place. Police and paramedics found the victim with serious injuries after being called to an address in Willenhall Drive in Hayes at 10.30 yesterday. She died at the scene, with a special post-mortem examination planned for tomorrow. The arrested man is in custody and it is believed he and Ms Hansen knew each other. Ms Hansen’s family has been informed of the tragedy and are being offered support. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, of the Specialist Crime Command, said his thoughts were with them as they ‘suffer an unimaginable loss’. ‘I know that this incident will have shocked people in the local community’,  he added. ‘While our investigation is still in its initial stages, I am confident that we are not looking for any further suspects and that there is no continuing risk to residents or the wider public. ‘As we work to build a picture of what happened to Stephanie, we would be interested to hear from anyone who knew her, had seen or spoken to her recently and who feels they may have relevant information to assist our investigation.’ Anyone who lives in or was driving close to Willenhall Drive in Hayes has been asked to come forward if they have CCTV or dashcam footage. Officers specifically want footage from between the morning of Friday December 30 and the morning of Saturday December 31. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
