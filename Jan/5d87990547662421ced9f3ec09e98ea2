A woman has been inked so that she has the Spotify code for her favourite song on her body forever. That way, she can use it to request the song to be played by DJs. Fátima Camarena has gone viral on TikTok for a clip that shows her presenting her tattoo to a DJ. In the video, which was filmed in Mexico, her friend Jonatan Zamora hovers his phone lens over the tattoo. As he does so, the Spotify playlist loads and the song starts playing over the speakers. And what’s the song, we hear you ask? It’s called Que Ricos Cocos (What Delicious Coconuts), by Mexican band Mi Banda El Mexicano. ‘She is a super fan of the band,’ said Jonatan. ‘While we were at a party, she asked to play that song (What Delicious Coconuts) because she was about to go to Cancun. ‘We all liked it because of the rhythm and the peculiar way in which Fátima sang it, and from then we put it in all the party playlists. ‘One day she went to get a tattoo and she came to us with the surprise that she had tattooed the song, so if she was at a party she would just need to stretch out her arm and say, “put that on.”‘ The video of Fátima putting her tattoo to use has earned a whopping 7.2 million views and 882,900 likes, and left viewers both stunned and impressed with her dedication to the sesh. One person commented: ‘She’s ready to party anytime.’ ‘This is too good,’ added someone else. While another viewer simply wrote: ‘SLAYYYY.’ Do you have a story to share?
