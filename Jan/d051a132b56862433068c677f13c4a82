A Russian warship armed with ‘unstoppable’ hypersonic missiles has sailed towards the US coast in a ‘show of strength’, reports say. The frigate – named Gorshkov – has been closely monitored by NATO boats on its maiden voyage. They have found the vessel is armed with 6,670mph Zircon missiles, which have a range of 625 miles. Radar monitoring sites suggest the Gorshkov, which has been recently tailed by the Portuguese navy, made an unexpected diversion in the Atlantic. An unconfirmed Russian Telegram channel report says it was ‘spotted on radar in neutral waters of the Atlantic Ocean – at an effective salvo launch distance from the US coast’. The Russian defence ministry has not commented on the Navodka channel’s claim. Vladimir Putin personally took part, albeit remotely, in the ceremony when the warship departed from Arctic naval base Severomorsk on January 4. He made it clear this mission was intended as a show of strength to the West. The despot said: ‘I am sure that such a powerful weapon will allow us to reliably protect Russia from potential external threats and help ensure our country’s national interests.’ Moscow has also boasted the Gorshkov is ‘the most dangerous enemy of surface ships in the world’s oceans’. One report said the vessel, which was escorted through the English Channel by the Royal Navy on January 11, had separated from its tailing tanker ship Kama in the Bay of Biscay and headed west. The frigate’s captain Igor Krokhmal has previously said: ‘No one will see the missile launch or its flight. ‘They will only see when the missile hits the target. ‘A surface target, a coastal target. I don’t think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
