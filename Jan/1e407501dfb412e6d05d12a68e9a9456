Manchester United will be without Anthony Martial and Diogo Dalot for today’s Premier League clash against Arsenal. Erik ten Hag’s side travel to the capital to take on the table-topping Gunners at the Emirates this afternoon. United can move to within five points of Mikel Arteta’s side with a win but they’ll be without Casemiro, who picked up a fifth yellow card as United conceded late on against Crystal Palace on Wednesday. That draw took some of the wind out of United’s sails and there was more bad news as the club travelled to London last night. Neither Martial nor Dalot were with the travelling party as the pair have failed to recover from injury complaints. Martial lasted just 45 minutes against Manchester City last Saturday, while Dalot hasn’t featured since the 3-0 win against Charlton in the EFL Cup. It could mean a second start for Wout Weghorst after the Dutchman started against Palace, having trained with his new team-mates just once following his move from Besiktas. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has excelled in Dalot’s absence and is expected to retain his spot.
