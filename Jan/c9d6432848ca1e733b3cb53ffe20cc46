Congratulations are in order for Molly-Mae and boyfriend Tommy Fury who have welcomed their first baby together. The Love Island stars, both 23, are overjoyed at the arrival of their new bundle of joy and shared a glimpse of their new baby girl on social media. In an Instagram post, the new proud parents are seen smiling with Molly-Mae in the hospital bed and Tommy cradling the little one in his arms. The caption confirms the date the tot was born, simply stating: ’23/01/23.’ Molly-Mae added in her Instagram stories: ‘One week old today. I can’t believe we get to keep you forever. ‘Becoming your mum has been the best thing to ever happen to me… it doesn’t seem possible but my love for you grows with each passing moment. There is no feeling like holding you in my arms little one, my heart literally explodes. ‘Thank you for entering the world safely for us and blessing us with the gift of being your parents. ‘We promise to love and and care for you unconditionally forever.’ The PrettyLittleThing creative director also shared a sweet video of their baby girl bundled up in Tommy’s arms as he rested on a chair. At one point, the boxer bends his head and plants a kiss on the newborn’s head. Tommy wrote in his own post: ‘I’ll protect you forever my little girl.’ Molly-Mae and Tommy are yet to reveal their daughter’s name. Several stars rushed to congratulate the happy couple, with former Love Island star and Molly-Mae’s best friend Maura Higgins, writing: ‘So so so proud of you always 🤍 she is so perfect.’ Montana Brown – who is also pregnant with her first child – writing: ‘Congrats gorgeous people ❤️ so happy for you both xxx.’ Chris Hughes commented: ‘Congrats both of you.’ Demi Jones added: ‘The biggest congratulations!!’ Tommy and Molly-Mae recently announced that they were expecting their first child together in an emotional video showing off the PrettyLittleThing creative director’s blossoming bump. Taking to Instagram to share the joyous news, the caption read: ‘I can’t wait for the adventures that we haven’t even dreamed of yet.’ The adorable montage showed Molly-Mae and Tommy declaring their love for each other in the 2019 Love Island final, before it quickly cut to a close-up of Molly’s baby bump with Tommy kissing her belly. Since then, the influencer kept followers updated throughout her pregnancy journey, sharing equally sweet snippets to social media, and also detailing how she was dealing with the physical changes. It’s the first baby for Molly and boxer Tommy, who met on the reality dating show, and the couple revealed last year that they had always been excited to start a family together. However, Molly was open about the fact that she was unsure if she’d ever be able to conceive. The creative director explained that she had not been on contraception throughout her and Tommy’s relationship, partly due to suffering from endometriosis and not finding a contraceptive method that suited her body. Molly opened up on the subject via a YouTube video, filmed at 13 weeks pregnant, in which she revealed how her body has changed since finding out she was to be a mum. She also told her followers of the ‘unusual’ baby name she had chosen for her daughter, in a Q&A with fans. The new mum admitted: ‘I’ve had the name picked out since I was basically a baby girl myself!’ She explained it has ‘always been my dream baby girl name, and luckily when I met Tommy and I told him the name…he absolutely loved it too.’ Congratulations to the new family of three.
