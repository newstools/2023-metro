Prince Harry lost his virginity to an older woman behind a ‘very busy pub’, his new memoir reveals. The duke’s autobiography, Spare, was leaked today after going on sale early in Spain. According to the Daily Mail, Harry has devoted a portion of the book to his first sexual encounter. It took place in a field when he was 17-years-old, the newspaper reports. Harry claims the pair had been behind a ‘very busy pub’ and that the woman treated him like a ‘young stallion’. The book also outlines how one of the Royal Family’s bodyguards Marko paid him a visit when he was still a pupil at Eton College in Windsor and told the Prince he had been sent to ‘find out the truth’. Harry writes: ‘I suspected he was referring to my recent loss of virginity, a humiliating episode with an older woman who liked macho horses and who treated me like a young stallion. ‘I mounted her quickly, after which she spanked my ass and sent me away. ‘One of my many mistakes was letting it happen in a field, just behind a very busy pub. No doubt someone had seen us.’ Prince Harry also admitted to taking cocaine when he was 17-years-old. ‘Of course I had been taking cocaine at that time,’ Sky News reported while quoting an extract from the book. ‘At someone’s house, during a hunting weekend, I was offered a line, and since then I had consumed some more. ‘It wasn’t very fun, and it didn’t make me feel especially happy as seemed to happen to others, but it did make me feel different, and that was my main objective. To feel. To be different. ‘I was a seventeen-year-old willing to try almost anything that would alter the pre-established order. ‘At least, that’s what I was trying to convince myself of.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
