A suspect arrested over the shooting of two people in Jerusalem the day after a gun massacre nearby is believed to be a 13-year-old boy. Officials say a father and son aged 47 and 23 were wounded before the attacker was shot and apprehended. The incident took place in a central neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, which is internationally recognised as an occupied territory and has a large minority of Jewish residents, many of whom identify as Israeli. It followed a shooting near a synagogue in a majority-Jewish suburb on Friday which killed seven people and wounded five, including a 15-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman. Worshippers were leaving prayers marking the start of the Sabbath when the gunman opened fire, stopping only to reload his cartridge. Eyewitnesses said one of the people he shot at was a young woman trying to give CPR to her husband while he lay dying from a gunshot. Police said the attacker tried to flee in a car before police officers gave chase and shot him dead after he tried to escape arrest by firing at them. He was identified by local Hebrew and Arab media as a 21-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem, Authorities described him as a ‘terrorist’ guilty of ‘one of the worst attacks we have encountered in recent years’. At least 42 people have been arrested in connection with the massacre. The 13-year-old boy is also Palestinian and ‘waited to ambush civilians on the holy Sabbath day’, officials added. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly condemned Friday’s attack,  tweeting: ‘Appalling reports of a terror attack in Neve Yaakov this evening.’ The fact the attack was staged on Holocaust Memorial Day was ‘horrific’, he added. Nine Palestinians, including both militants and civilians, were killed during an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.
