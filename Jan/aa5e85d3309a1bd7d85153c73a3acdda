Kelly Webster had only popped out for a pint of milk. But her innocent trip to the shops took a dramatic turn on New Year’s Day. To avoid hitting several seagulls, she ended up veering off the road and into a muddy field. Despite the best efforts of Kelly, her partner Michael and her daughter Jorja – the Toyota Corolla remained well and truly stuck. The couple tried everything they could to try and free it, even making use of an old carpet. Kelly, 36, said: ‘The car came off the path when they tried to avoid seagulls and into the mud and as much as he tried to get it out he couldn’t. ‘I got a phone call saying car is stuck, but don’t worry we are having lots of fun. ‘My partner got a lift of his mate and dropped my daughter off and went back to try to get the car out with his mate. ‘They tried everything even found an old dirty carpet but still no joy.’ Kelly, from Bolton, added: ‘Even my partner was covered head to toe in mud. ‘The next day he went and tried again and still couldn’t so his mate rang someone from a farm nearby to ask if they could help, so they were going to come the next morning to help.’ The car was stuck for two days before it was rescued by a local garage. In the interim period, concerned locals had shared photos and worried that the vehicle may have been stolen and dumped. Kelly said: ‘I hadn’t seen the state of the car then, when all of a sudden I was on Facebook and my car was all over it. ‘When I saw the posts and comments I couldn’t stop laughing and to all you Toyota Corolla haters, it’s actually a fast car. ‘I am currently still waiting to get it back so relying on lifts at the minute and had to get taxis.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
