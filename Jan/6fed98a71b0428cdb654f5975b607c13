There’s never going to be a perfect time to take stock and prioritise your wellness – something will always get in the way – but January is as good a time as any, while many of us are thinking about what we want from the year ahead. A new job, travel, exercising, more partying, less partying… whatever ‘wellness’ goals look like to you, it can be hard to carve out the time to make them happen – even if we know they’re good for our headspace. This is where a wellness journal can help. A quick place to jot down thoughts, plans and reflections, it can keep you on track and ensure the decisions you’re making around your wellbeing are conscious and considered. Think of it like a diary that can take any shape and be as disordered as you like. There are no hard and fast rules. All you have to do now is pick the one that appeals most to your aesthetics and let yourself be guided by it. Want to put pen to paper? We’ve rounded up some of our favourites below.
