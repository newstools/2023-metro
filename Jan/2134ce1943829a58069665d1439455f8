Brits will be hit by heavy rain this week, with yellow warnings issued for certain spots. Flooding of homes and businesses is ‘likely’ and transport will be disrupted in the northwest of England, the West Midlands and west Wales on Tuesday. Interruption to power supplies and other services is also a bleak possibility in these areas, as strong winds also sweep in. A yellow alert is in place all day from 6am to 8pm for spots including Manchester, Preston and Lancaster. A second similar yellow warning stands for places like Shropshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Barmouth and Rhayader. ‘Outbreaks of rain will spread across England and Wales during Tuesday’, the Met Office warns. ‘This will be heaviest and most persistent across parts of Wales, particularly over higher ground. ‘Rainfall totals of 80-100 mm could accumulate over high ground.’ The situation won’t get much better as heavy showers and strong winds are also anticipated on Wednesday and Thursday. It comes as another warning in north-western Scotland runs until 2pm today. A total of 29 flood warnings are in place for England, 12 in Scotland and three in Wales. It comes as experts warn a ‘pothole crisis’ is gripping the UK – and it’s all down to the winter freeze that left roads blighted with cracks and holes.
