Some amusing photoshop fails sent in by fraudsters trying to receive benefits were released. The fake pictures, published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), include men and women posing across a variety of scenes and outside homes. They were sent to officials by people trying to prove they live in the UK and are entitled to receive benefits. A photo shows a woman holding a toddler, while another shows a couple outside a home – but all are clearly pasted over the top of screengrabs from Google Maps. The DWP said fake claims add up to billions each year. Officials say ‘there is no suggestion that the people in these images have committed fraud or they are in any way affiliated with the location they are pictured at’. It is thought the fraudsters just use photos they find online and paste them. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: ‘When the pandemic hit, we saw a surge in Universal Credit claims, which demanded an extraordinary response to help all those in urgent need. ‘Regrettably, unscrupulous fraudsters took advantage but we are rooting them out and have already reviewed 900,000 claims. ‘We made savings from correction and prevention of fraud and error of £2 billion last year alone. ‘But we’re going much further, through our robust fraud plan to prevent £2 billion of loss over the next three years, and over £4 billion over the next five years.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
