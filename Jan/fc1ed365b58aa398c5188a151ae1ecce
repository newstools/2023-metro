Disgruntled residents fed up with the state of their pothole-ridden street spray-painted a rude message on it – demanding: ‘Fix me, I’m f****d.’ The graffiti was daubed in huge white letters outside a row of residential homes along Ermine Street in Ancaster, Lincolnshire. An arrow points to an apparently botched pothole repair, saying ‘Do me again’, while another area of concern is circled, accompanied by the message ‘I’m so bored now’. Each pothole on the road was individually circled by the mystery vandal before they were discovered on New Year’s Day. Shannon Blankley, who lives in the village, said: ‘Waking up and seeing this made my day. Whoever done it, big round of applause for you. About time someone did something. ‘We should all stand together on this. It’s getting past the joke and just cost us money. You can’t even avoid the potholes any more. ‘We need 100-plus cones put in each pothole – soon get council talking then.’ Another resident told BBC Look North: ‘Personally, I think it is quite funny. ‘I know some people are offended by the language but, if it gets attention, I think that is probably a good thing in the end.’ Other neighbours said their houses regularly shook due to lorries hitting the potholes. Lincolnshire County Council criticised the stunt and said permanent repairs were due to be carried out in March. The messages have since been removed.
