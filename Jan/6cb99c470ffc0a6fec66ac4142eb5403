Illegal drugs have been discovered inside a packet of Aunt Bessie’s roast potatoes. Police made the find after stopping a man seen acting ‘suspiciously’ in a Ford Focus. The vehicle housed a small amount of suspected amphetamine, a burner phone and money. Officers went on to raid the man’s home in Wirral, Merseyside, on January 24. A further raid was then carried out an address in Bromborough where a large quantity of suspected amphetamine was found stashed in the fridge. It was there that police found the suspected drugs hidden inside a bag of Aunt Bessie’s roasties. Amphetamine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy, and obesity. It is also commonly used as a recreational drug. Community Policing Inspector Daniel Greenhalgh, of Merseyside Police, said: ‘Thanks to proactive policing work a significant amount of drugs have been removed from our streets which cause harm in our communities. ‘Stop searches, warrants, land searches and arrests take place all year round, and in many instances it is thanks to the public who tell us where there are issues in the community. ‘If you have anti-social behaviour or criminality in your area let us know and we will take action.’ Officers had also discovered bags of white powder, cannabis and numerous individual wraps of amphetamine in the raid. A 63-year-old man from Bromborough was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled Class B drug – amphetamine. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
