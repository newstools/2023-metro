EastEnders icons Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) and Phil Micthell (Steve McFadden) have reunited this week and we’re all losing our minds. The pair cuddled up for a selfie in front of Tower Bridge, which Cheryl shared for her Instagram followers. In the caption, she thanked her buddy for his hospitality and referred to him as her ‘big brov’. Former co-star Danniella Westbrook, who previously played Phil’s sister Sam Mitchell (now played by Kim Medcalf), shared her love with a comment on the post, saying: ‘Send him my love please’. Brookside actress Claire Sweeney also commented, ‘Love Stevie’, followed by a love heart emoji. Cheryl left the role of Heather back in 2012, in heart breaking scenes that saw her brutally murdered by Phil’s son Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden, played at the time by  Joshua Pascoe). She has recently appeared in a production of Cinderella in Stockport. Meanwhile, Phil is still running the square, having recently defeated nemesis DCI Keeble, after she kidnapped Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her son Tommy (Sonny Kendall).
