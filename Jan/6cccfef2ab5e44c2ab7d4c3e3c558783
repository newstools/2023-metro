Pep Guardiola told Joao Cancelo he could leave Manchester City after a nasty bust-up between the manager and player, according to reports. Cancelo is on the verge of joining Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich on loan in a shock January move and the German side reportedly have a £61.5m buy option. The Portugal international, who has won back-to-back Premier League titles and has also lifted the Carabao Cup during his time at the Etihad, had been a key part of Guardiola’s side. But the defender, 28, fell out of favour after returning from the World Cup in Qatar, starting just three of City’s 10 matches and is now heading to Germany. Many had been puzzled by Cancelo’s lack of game time at City and the Daily Mail have now reported that there has been a huge bust-up with his boss Guardiola. The fall out is said to have occurred at the club’s training ground with Cancelo believed to have become a disruptive member of the squad. His relationship with Guardiola has rapidly deteriorated and the full-back was said to have been furious after not being named in the starting XI for City’s FA Cup win over Arsenal on Friday. It allegedly got so bad that Cancelo threatened to leave the club after reaching ‘breaking point’ with Guardiola, leading to City allowing him to leave for Bayern. Guardiola is also thought to be open to letting Cancelo leave after being impressed with Rico Lewis’ emergence and with Nathan Ake’s performances. Cancelo moved to City from Juventus in a £60m deal in 2019 and has made a total of 154 appearances for the club, registering nine goals and 22 assists. He is currently under contract until 2027 having signed an extension around a year ago and was named in the Premier League Team of the Year in both 2021 and 2022.
