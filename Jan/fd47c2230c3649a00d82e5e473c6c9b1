Things came to a head for Kyle Winchester (Huey Quinn) in tonight’s Emmerdale as he was formally charged with Al’s murder, leaving Moira Barton (Natalie J Robb) and the rest of the family in turmoil. The youngster found himself in a terrifying situation back in October 2022 when he wandered in on a violent altercation between Al and dad Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). Having picked up the shotgun, a startled Kyle accidentally shot Al, much to Cain’s horror. Since then, Cain has been in prison, having confessed to the murder that his son committed. His plan to cover up what Kyle had done was going swimmingly, until the arrival of estranged brother Caleb (Will Ash). Fearing for Kyle’s wellbeing and state of mind, Caleb had words with him, and ultimately convinced him to come clean. Making his way to the police station with a bloodied jumper for evidence, Kyle confessed to the crime that had put his father in prison. Tonight, it was revealed that the police had enough evidence to charge the child, despite Cain sticking to the story that he was the one to blame. Moira was left devastated as she was informed that Kyle would spend one more night at home, before being transferred to a local authority children’s home, where he would await a hearing at a youth magistrates court. Cain was equally hurt by the news, instantly blaming Caleb and questioning how Moira could ever have trusted him after all of his warnings. With Moira still hopeful that Caleb’s solicitors can get Kyle a non-custodial sentence, Cain is adamant that it’s all over for him. Will the judge and jury be lenient, or is Kyle set to go to prison for a very long time?
