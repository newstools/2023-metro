Manchester City defender Joao Cancelo is on the verge of joining Bayern Munich on loan. The 28-year-old has won back-to-back Premier League titles during his time at City and has been a key part of Pep Guardiola’s side. But Cancelo has fallen out of favour since returning from the World Cup with Portugal, starting just three of City’s 10 matches. City have now agreed to allow Cancelo to join Bayern Munich on loan for the remainder of the season. According to MailOnline, City have also given Bayern the option to sign Cancelo on a permanent deal for €70 million (£61.5m). Speaking earlier this month, Guardiola suggested that Cancelo was among the players he was unhappy with due to his body language in training. ‘Every time it is difficult to choose the team for me — always top players are not playing,’ Guardiola said. ‘Lately, as I get older, I mainly look at the body language. In the training sessions and everything. You cannot play good when the body language is not correct. ‘Sometimes you choose the players for how happy they are. That is one of the main decisions with choosing the line-up, because with the skills, I know how good they are. ‘The body language depends on them and sometimes they are not good and it is more difficult.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
