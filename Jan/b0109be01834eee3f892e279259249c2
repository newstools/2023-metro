A 10-year-old ‘Del Boy’ is making a tasty profit re-selling empty bottles of Prime. Charlie Smith braved enormous queues in the cold outside Asda to get his hands on the popular drinks. After guzzling them down, the schoolboy decided to flog the bottles on his mum’s eBay account. It turned out to be a shrewd decision as he sold five empties for £12. The ‘hydration’ drinks normally retail at £1.99 in stores, meaning Charlie is making about 40p profit per bottle. Charlie, from Nottingham, has even started paying other youngsters £1 for their empty bottles to sell them as well. ‘I love it,’ the budding entrepreneur said. ‘I love making money. I want to be a businessman when I’m older.’ His dad Adam Smith, 38, thinks it’s ridiculous people are paying for rubbish, but he ‘can’t argue’ as his son is making money. He said: ‘He’s very good with his money, he doesn’t like spending it, put it that way, so he just thinks it’s brilliant that he can drink it for free. ‘He likes trying to buy and sell anything to make a profit. Charlie’s a bit like a little Del Boy.’ Prime was created by YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI who have used their online platforms to create huge demand from their millions of young followers. It is marketed as a hydration drink rather than an energy drink as it does not contain caffeine, and is made up of water and coconut water with added vitamins and minerals. Prime queues have descended into ‘absolute carnage’ across the UK, with grown adults filmed pushing and shoving children to get their hands on bottles. Hype around the drinks has created a booming resale market on Amazon and eBay, where fifteen-pack boxes are on sale for as much as £200.
