The new year brings changes to the McDonald’s menu as the fast food chain has revealed a switch up – and a brand new item. So, what’s the new arrival in question? Expect something a little spicy for 2023. McDonald’s has announced it will be launching a new ‘big flavour’ wrap known as ‘the Spicy Sriracha Chicken One.’ It’ll be made up of crispy chicken breast or grilled chicken, spicy sriracha sauce, cucumber, onions, and lettuce – all in a soft, toasted wrap. It’s due to land tomorrow, January 4, but will only be available for a limited time only – exclusive to the UK and Ireland. Gráinne Allen, the director of food and innovation, at McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said: ‘The Spicy Sriracha Chicken One brings something different to the wrap family and we hope customers are as excited by it as we are. ‘We are always looking for different ways to innovate and meet consumers needs and knowing how well-loved the Big Flavour Wraps – it made sense to add to this family.’ But this new wrap isn’t the only new addition to the menu. It seems the chain will be bringing back old favourites tomorrow too – such as the Aero Chocolate McFlurry, Aero Peppermint McFlurry, and Cheesy Garlic Bites. The Double McPlant is also expected to arrive in restaurants very shortly. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
