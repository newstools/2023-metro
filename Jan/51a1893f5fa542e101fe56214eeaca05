Mykhailo Mudryk is at Stamford Bridge as his €100 million (£88.6m) move to Chelsea has now been completed. Arsenal have been negotiating with Shakhtar Donetsk for several weeks but despite agreeing personal terms with the winger, they were unable to reach an agreement with the Ukrainian club. That has allowed Chelsea to move in quickly and they agreed a €100m (£88.6m) deal with Shakhtar on Saturday evening worth €70m (£62m) up front plus €30m (£26.6m) in add-ons. Chelsea’s co-owner Behdad Eghbali and director of global transfers Paul Winstanley travelled to Turkey on Saturday, where Shakhtar are training, and returned to London with Mudryk on their private jet. Mudryk has now signed a eight-and-a-half year contract with Chelsea worth in excess of £100,000 a week – significantly higher than the £50,000-a-week package on offer from Arsenal. The 21-year-old was in attendance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday for Chelsea’s Premier League match against Crystal Palace and the club confirmed the transfer during the first half. ‘I’m so happy to sign for Chelsea,’ Mudryk said after completing his move to Chelsea. ‘This is a huge club, in a fantastic league and it is a very attractive project for me at this stage of my career. ‘I’m excited to meet my new team-mates and I’m looking forward to working and learning under Graham Potter and his staff.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
