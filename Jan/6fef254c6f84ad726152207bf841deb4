Police have released CCTV images of two women they want to identify after a man was beaten in a brutal attack on the street. The victim, in his 30s, was taken to hospital after an early hour brawl broke out in Nottingham city centre. Paramedics and police scrambled to Thurland Street at 4.30am on November 5 last year. Nottinghamshire Police said the man ‘thankfully’ didn’t come to life-altering harm, but was left injured and emotionally shaken. Officers have released pictures of two young women they believe could hold vital clues in the case. One of the women has long dark hair and was wearing a yellow patterned jumpsuit. Another had a blonde ponytail and wore a pink and white hoodie on the morning in question. Detective Constable Helen Pannell said: ‘We’ve been working hard to piece together exactly what happened that night and are now seeking help to try and identify these two females. ‘Officers are looking to speak to and who are believed to have vital information that could help with their investigation. ‘Thankfully the victim did not receive any life-altering injuries but this assault will have understandably left him not only with physical injuries but also affected him emotionally as well. ‘We believe they may have vital information that could really help with our inquires so would urge them to come forward or anyone who recognises them to contact us.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
