Prince Harry revealed he smoked a spliff and watched a Disney film after his first date with Meghan Markle. The couple first met in London in 2016 after which Harry met with a friend to tell him all about the date. After Harry ‘barged into his house off the King’s Road’, the pair started drinking and put on a film. ‘Out came the tequila. Out came the weed. We drank and smoked and watched… Inside Out,’ he wrote in highly-anticipated biography ‘Spare’. Harry recalled he felt ‘peacefully numb’ from the ‘good weed’, until he received a Facetime call from Meghan, telling his friend: ‘Oh shit, it’s her.’ Presumably hearing the Disney film in the background, Meghan asked him if he was watching cartoons, to which he replied: ‘No, I mean, yeah. It’s… Inside Out.’ ‘I moved to a quiet corner of the flat. She was back at her hotel. She had washed her face, and I said “God, I love your freckles. That’s insane, they’re beautiful”.’ The pair chatted for a while before agreeing to meet for a second date at Soho House. In a recent Netflix documentary, Harry revealed he first became interested in Meghan after seeing a video of her dancing with a Snapchat filter on her face on a friend’s Instagram feed. He made clear to his friend he wanted to meet Meghan – then an actress on TV drama Suits – before the two swapped numbers and began talking.
