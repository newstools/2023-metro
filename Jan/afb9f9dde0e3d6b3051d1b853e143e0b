A white car was left coated in human waste after a firework launched down a manhole by a pair of kids caused a bigger blast than expected. The dangerous prank was the latest example to come out of China, where several similar explosions have been captured on video in recent years. Footage from the city of Leshan, in Sichuan Province, last Tuesday shows the two youngsters wearing hooded jackets in a car park. One lights a firework and directs it below the manhole cover, which is blown into the air almost immediately as the pair run for cover. The bright purple flame that shoots out suggests trapped methane might be to blame for the particularly ferocious explosion. The force is so intense, another manhole cover further away in the car park can also be seen jumping up slightly. A white sedan that was parked directly beside the sewer opening gets the worst of the resulting stink, with another camera angle showing the extent of its new paintwork. Local police said another car was damaged by the metal cover as it fell back down to earth. The two perpetrators made it away from the scene uninjured. A number of videos showing young people in China causing sewer explosions have appeared online in recent years. One incident from February 2020 involved an eight-year-old boy who inserted sparklers into the holes of a manhole cover in Chifeng city, causing pavement bricks to be launched from the ground. Like the pair in Leshan, he left the scene unharmed. Police in China have urged parents to tell their children not to play with fireworks.
