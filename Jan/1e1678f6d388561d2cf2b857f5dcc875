A man has been charged with a series of terrorism offences after an incident at the maternity ward of a hospital in Leeds. Patients and NHS staff at the Gledhow wing of St James’s Hospital were evacuated after the security scare last Friday. Mohammad Farooq, 27, of Roundhay, has been charged with terrorism, explosives and firearm offences in connection with the incident. He was allegedly spotted with a suspected firearm and suspicious package at the site. Army specialists and a bomb disposal unit were also called to the hospital and a cordon was put in place as a ‘precautionary measure’. The suspect has since been remanded in custody and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London via video link tomorrow. DCS James Dunkerley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said there is currently ‘no evidence of an increased risk to the public’. He added: ‘These enquiries have confirmed our initial assessment that this was an isolated incident. ‘Despite this, the UK threat level remains at substantial, and history has shown us we can’t afford to be complacent. ‘Public vigilance is invaluable in supporting the efforts of Counter Terrorism Policing and its partners to protect our communities from harm. ‘We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the public during this investigation. ‘We would particularly like to thank the staff and patients at St James’s Hospital for their patience and cooperation throughout the disruption last Friday.’ Got a story?
