Two brothers who wielded shotguns and fired a shot inside a Spar store before threatening staff have been jailed, a court heard. Brothers, Matthew, 41 and Christopher Reece, 36, raided the store in Telford, Shropshire, on October 21, 2021. Shrewsbury Crown Court heard how during the morning robbery, one of the shotguns was discharged and threats were made to kill. Nobody was injured by the gunshot, but a wall was damaged. The pair stole cash and cigarettes and during an investigation it was found the brothers had planned the robbery and visited the shop beforehand. On Friday, the brothers were jailed for 12 years each having been found guilty of robbery and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. Detective Inspector Sean Brennan, from West Mercia Police, said: ‘Matthew and Christopher Reece are clearly violent and dangerous individuals who went into a busy convenience store first thing on a weekday morning both armed with a shotguns. ‘They threatened customers and staff and caused even more fear by using one of the shotguns; while no one was injured by the gunshot the consequences could have been far worse and those in the store at the time have quite understandably been left traumatised by the robbery. ‘I’m pleased with the significant sentence that has been given today and am pleased that the pair are behind bars where they cannot cause more harm to our communities.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
