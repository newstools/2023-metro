A man has been charged with assaulting former health secretary Matt Hancock on the London Underground. Geza Tarjanyi, 61, from Leyland in Lancashire, will appear in court next month. He is accused of common assault and two public order offences. The MP for West Suffolk is not thought to have been hurt during the alleged incident on Tuesday. BTP received a report of a man being ‘assaulted and harassed’ at the station next to the House of Commons before 9am. The encounter is said to have continued on a Tube train. A spokesman for Mr Hancock has named it an ‘unpleasant encounter’. He went onto praise both Transport for London staff and British Transport Police workers, saying they were ‘fantastic’. Tarjanyi was released on bail to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on February 22. Mr Hancock led the country’s response to the Covid pandemic alongside former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He resigned after leaked CCTV images showed him kissing an adviser in his office, in breach of his own social distancing guidance. His colleagues and constituents were left angry when he jetted to the Australian jungle to appear on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! last year. Lioness and Euro 2022 winner Jill Scott won, but Mr Hancock came in third place behind Hollyoaks star Owen Warner. After being stripped of the Conservative whip over the reality TV appearance, he will not contest his seat at the next election. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
