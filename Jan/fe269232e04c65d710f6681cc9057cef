A man has been taken to hospital after being stabbed in luxury department store Harrods. Horrified shoppers looked on as a fight broke out in the shop in the upscale area of Knightsbridge, London. Reports on social media claimed the dispute on Saturday night was over a watch in the Louis Vuitton section, although this remains unconfirmed. An ambulance raced to the scene after a man in his 20s suffered ‘stab/slash injuries’. His condition is not life-threatening. No arrests have been made but an investigation has been launched, the Metropolitan Police said last night. A statement read: ‘Police were called at 19:33hrs on Saturday, 28 January, to a fight inside the Harrods store in Brompton Road, SW1. ‘Officers attended and found a man, aged in his 20s, suffering stab/slash injuries. He has been taken to hospital by ambulance. His condition has been assessed as not life-threatening. ‘Detectives from the Met’s Central West CID are investigating. Cordons are in place at the location. ‘There has been no arrest at this early stage. Enquiries continue.’ Harrods and LVMH, Louis Vuitton’s parent organisation, have been contacted for comment.
