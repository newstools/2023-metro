A fleet of eco-friendly, electric bin wagons have been ‘hidden’ by civic chiefs – because there aren’t enough power points to charge them, a councillor claims. York City Council spent £8million on 25 vehicles to replace diesel trucks – but they are sitting idle as they can’t be powered up. Cllr Mark Warters said the ­situation was farcical and an embarrassment. He also claimed taxpayers’ money has been wasted to store the fleet at a contractor’s yard – allegations city bosses deny. ‘The vehicles haven’t been used yet. The council is behind with installing a charging infrastructure but because they’d already ­procured the vehicles, they’ve had to accept them,’ the independent councillor, 58, said. ‘You would have thought there would be satisfactory due diligence carried out before you engage in a project to turn a local authority fleet over from diesel to electric. ‘The wider side of this is, even when they get chargers in place, how do you manage a fleet when there are council workers that will start at ridiculous hours… 5am in the morning? ‘It’s always been accepted practice that those people take vehicles home with them. So they’re already questioning how that system would work,’ he added. The council admitted construction of the charging points was behind schedule but claimed it had been wiser to buy the vehicles early due to rising inflation costs.
