A father walking his daughter’s two dogs during lockdown was trampled to death by cows in a stampede that also left his widow paralysed. Telecoms worker Michael Holmes, 57, died at the scene and his wife Teresa was airlifted to hospital after the attack on a public right of way in September 2020, an inquest heard. The couple, both working from home, had walked across the nearby farmer’s field in Wakefield, West Yorkshire ‘scores of times’. But this time CCTV showed the cows charge at them as they reached the end of the footpath while the whippets Neville and Luna – both on leads – ran off. A neighbour who found them raised the alarm. Mr Holmes’ heart was bruised and cut and he suffered 35 rib fractures. A pathologist said his heart injuries alone were not survivable. Mrs Holmes, who was knocked unconscious, woke in hospital a week later then spent six months recovering from back and rib injuries. The former children’s services worker is medically retired and uses a wheelchair. The inquest continues. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
