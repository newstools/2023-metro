A fan was able to stroll onto the pitch during Manchester United’s clash with Crystal Palace to take a selfie with midfielder Casemiro. In the 56th minute of Wednesday’s Premier League clash at Selhurst Park, the spectator was able to run across the length of the pitch towards Casemiro, who was stood on the half-way line near the dugouts. The Brazil international paused to take the photo before ushering him on. Still recording from his mobile phone, the fan was able to stroll off the pitch in the other direction with no stewards in sight. Later on in the game, Casemiro was shown a yellow card for a wild lunge on Wilfried Zaha. The midfielder will now miss Sunday’s huge showdown with Arsenal as a result. United had taken the lead at the end of the first-half through Bruno Fernandes, just minutes after David de Gea had produced a stunning save down the other end. But the visitors were pegged back in the 90th minute after a wonderful free kick from Michael Olise. It ends United’s run of nine consecutive wins with Erik ten Hag’s side missing the chance to go second.
