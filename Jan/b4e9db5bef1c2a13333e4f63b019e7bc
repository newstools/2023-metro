Sir Keir Starmer will use his first speech of the year to promise a ‘decade of national renewal’. It comes after Rishi Sunak revealed his ‘five point plan’ in an announcement today. The Prime Minister vowed to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists, and ‘stop the boats’. After months of turmoil within the Conservative Party, Mr Sunak was handed the keys to No 10 following his promise to deliver stability. But his party is still lagging behind Labour in the polls, as inflation continues to hit households and concerns about challenges in the NHS grow. Sir Keir, speaking from Stratford in East London, will soon set out his plan to end ‘sticking plaster politics in Westminster.’ In a speech tomorrow, he is expected to pledge to bring back ‘the hope we used to take for granted’ and ‘show light at the end of the tunnel.’ However, the Labour leader will also state: ‘let me be clear – none of this should be taken as code for Labour getting its big government chequebook out again. ‘Of course investment is required – I can see the damage the Tories have done to our public services as plainly as anyone. ‘But we won’t be able to spend our way out of their mess – it’s not as easy as that.’ The Conservatives and Labour have repeatedly been at odds over each major crisis the UK faced in 2022 – from Covid to the cost of living crisis. Currently, the Government has blamed high numbers of flu cases, Covid-19 and Strep A fears for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas. But it comes as health leaders have warned that the problems are longstanding and cannot solely be pinned on the pandemic. Making specific reference to the NHS, Starmer will tomorrow talk about how the multiple crises affecting the country have each been ‘an iceberg on the horizon … time and again it’s the same pattern.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
