If you fancy a trip to the Garden of Wales without staying on a roll mat in a shoddily constructed tent, you’re in luck. Staycationers can now stay in a converted double-decker bus parked up on a 22-acre meadow in Carmarthenshire, Wales, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The iconic British bus, which sleeps up to four guests, still has loads of its original features, including a driver’s seat, stop buttons and passenger rails. But, unlike your average Stagecoach, this bus has two bedrooms – one with a double bed – as well as cooking facilities and a cosy dining area at the back. The Airbnb also comes kitted out with wine glasses, a mini-fridge and board games, so you’ll never get bored. There’s even a fitted fireplace to keep the bus toasty during the colder nights. For when the weather lightens up a bit, there’s a fire pit outside, where families and friends can take in the fresh air and lush Welsh views. Plus, there’s an outdoor toilet, for privacy. The private nature reserve is brimming with stunning lakes, flower meadows and huge oaks for children to play in. Plus, Carmarthenshire is home to the National Botanical Garden of Wales – hence the nickname – and there is tons to explore, from hiking trails to mediaeval castles. For this unusual Airbnb, guests can expect to fork out from £98 per night – but book quickly, stays are being snapped up by the day. Do you have a story to share?
