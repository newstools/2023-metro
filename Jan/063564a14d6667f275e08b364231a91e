The Duke had previously told how he taught his great-grandmother to snap her fingers like the comic rapper, but during the interview, he performed the impression himself. Twitter users were quick to mock the Prince online. During his tell-all interview with Tom Bradby he also made claims about how the Royal family ‘got into bed with the devil’ and also believed his mum was still alive after her death.
