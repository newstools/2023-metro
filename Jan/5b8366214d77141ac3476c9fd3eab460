Stacey Solomon may be nine months pregnant, but Joe Swash is still counting on some â€˜sexy time.â€™ Unfortunately for him, though, heâ€™s getting absolutely nothing, with Stacey admitting any frisky antics are a â€˜physical impossibilityâ€™ at the moment. The former X Factor star, 33, and ex-EastEnders actor, 41, are currently expecting their third child together, with Stacey set to pop any day now. They already share Rex, who was born in May 2019, and daughter Rose, born on Staceyâ€™s 32nd birthday in October 2021. Stacey and Joe are also a happily blended family, as Joe was already father to son Harry, 14, from his previous relationship with ex-fiancee Emma Sophocleous, while Stacey has sons Zach, 14, and Leighton, 10, with former partners Dean Cox and Aaron Barnham respectively. The Loose Women panelist is due to welcome baby number five any day now, and thereâ€™s certainly no missing her massive bump. Sadly, said bump also got in the way of Joeâ€™s birthday celebrations, after Stacey asked her followers what they should do for the day. â€˜Have some sexy time to get baby movingâ€™, one Instagram follower joked, to which Stacey responded with a hilarious video filmed as the couple ventured out in their car. Passenger princess Stacey chuckled: â€˜And obviously, this was Joeâ€™s favourite answer. â€˜In fact, it was the first thing he said to me when dad came and picked up the kids.â€™ An unimpressed Joe hit back from the driverâ€™s seat: â€˜Youâ€™re saying it like I was right off the mark!â€™ A frustrated Stacey shouted back: â€˜You are! Itâ€™s a physical impossibility right now!â€™ â€˜I said, dadâ€™s picked the kids up, itâ€™s just me and youâ€¦ that is definitely a hint that itâ€™s timeâ€¦â€™ Joe defended. â€˜No, itâ€™s not time. How would it even happen?â€™, Stacey asked. â€˜I honestly donâ€™t know how people do it,â€™ she added, before laughing that she canâ€™t even put her own socks on. Turning the camera to show off her belly, she said: â€˜I canâ€™t even walk up the stairs without hyperventilating, if you think I can do anything like that right nowâ€¦ Look at me!â€™ The Essex star did later share a sweet birthday tribute for her husband, though, whom she married last year in their beloved Pickle Cottage. Posing for an adorable mirror selfie with bump front and centre, Stacey wrote in her caption: â€˜ðŸ–¤ Happy Birthday Bub ðŸ–¤ To the moon & back always & foreverâ€¦ love u.â€™ Ahead of their outing, she addd: â€˜So Excited for a child free dinner! (except bumpy ðŸ˜‚) Itâ€™s been A LONNNG time. Thanks to the legend that is Dave my dad for babysitting the brood love you ðŸ–¤â€™ Got a story?
