France and Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has announced his retirement from international football. The 36-year-old ends his international career as France’s most-capped player with 145 appearances across 14 years. Lloris was part of France’s World Cup triumph in 2018, and came close to a second trophy in December as his side were beaten by Argentina in the final in Qatar. Lloris, who has been at Tottenham since 2012, also won the Nations League with France in 2021. ‘There comes a time when you have to know how to hand over,’ Lloris told L’Equipe. ‘I don’t want to take over, I have always said and repeated that the French team does not belong to anyone, and we must all make sure that this is the case, me first. I think that behind, the team is ready to continue, there is also a keeper who is ready [Mike Maignan]. ‘I prefer to go out when I’m at my best than wait for a slump, or the competition of too much. There is also a family choice, I feel the need to spend more time with my wife and children.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
