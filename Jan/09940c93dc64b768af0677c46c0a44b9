A man suspected of stealing a four-year-old’s Christmas money at a toy shop is being hunted by police. Dougie Wilson had gone with his mother to Smyth’s Toys at Ipswich’s Anglia Retail Park to pick out what he wanted to buy for his £60 Christmas treat. But the little boy accidentally dropped his money on the floor inside the shop as he looked around. CCTV captured a man wearing dark clothes allegedly picking up the cash before leaving the store without handing it in. Police have released a picture of a man they want to speak to in connection with the alleged theft, which took place between 11.30am and 12pm on Tuesday, December 27. Anyone who recognises him should contact Suffolk Police. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
