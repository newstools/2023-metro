Ferries to and from Calais have been suspended today due to a national strike in France. The Port of Dover is still open with services to Dunkirk running as normal, but travellers should expect roads in Kent to be ‘busier than usual’. ‘Please plan ahead, allowing extra time for your journey and traffic systems that are in place to minimise delays,’ the seaport said. ‘Calais sailings are expected to resume at approximately 2pm UTC from Dover.’ P&O Ferries said it has produced an ‘optimised’ sailing schedule in light of the 24-hour walkout – known as the National Day of Action in France – but the level of disruption can’t be anticipated. ‘It is expected that this action will affect multiple outlets and services throughout France,’ it said. The company added: ‘Due to the lack of details, we cannot anticipate the level of disruption this will have to our optimised schedule, and it is possible that our wider operations could be affected throughout the day. ‘Please be assured that we will attempt to limit this disruption wherever possible however, if your journey is not essential, we do advise that you rearrange your travel to an alternative date.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
