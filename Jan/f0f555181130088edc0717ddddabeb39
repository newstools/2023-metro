Enzo Fernandez has told Benfica that he wants to join Chelsea as the two clubs now expect a deal to be completed, according to reports in Portugal. Chelsea are keen to strengthen their midfield options and have made Fernandez, who played a key role in Argentina’s World Cup win last month, their top target for the January transfer window. A fee is yet to be agreed with Benfica but Chelsea are understood to have agreed in principle to pay £112 million, which is over the midfielder’s £106m release clause but allows the Premier League club to split the deal in instalments. Benfica president Rui Costa had attempted to persuade Fernandez to stay with the Portuguese club until the end of the season. But according to Portuguese newspaper Record, Costa has now agreed to sell Fernandez and super agent Jorge Mendes has travelled to London to finalise negotiations with Chelsea. The report also claims that Fernandez told Benfica’s head coach Roger Schmidt on Tuesday that his immediate priority is to join Chelsea. Chelsea, meanwhile, are also exploring the possibility of signing Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhaylo Mudryk ahead of Arsenal. The Gunners have already seen their opening offer for the Ukraine international turned down, with Shakhtar holding out for a fee in the region of £85m. Mudryk has indicated that he would welcome the chance to join Arsenal this month. Chelsea have also agreed a £34m deal with Monaco to sign their 21-year-old centre-back Benoit Badiashile. The club are also expected to complete their £63m move for RB Leipzig forward Christopher Nkunku at the end of the season. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
