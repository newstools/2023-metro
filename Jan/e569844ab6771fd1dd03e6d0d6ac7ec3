Nostalgic for simpler times when all your music lived on a single device and phones were for making calls and sending texts? Before our lives were overtaken by smartphones and multitasking, came the humble iPod. Last year, Apple discontinued the iPod music player after more than 20 years on the market. So, if you’re hoping to recreate the experience of listening to music on an iPod, there’s an app for that. The app called Retro Pod is currently doing the rounds on social media in recent weeks after various posts about it went viral. Dubbed as a ‘a simple music player’, it is currently number 11 on the App Store’s chart of Music apps. The app works by pulling music from your Apple Music library into the iPod-like interface. It even has the satisfying click wheel which works just like the old music player, with haptic feedback while scrolling. Sadly, the app does not work with Spotify but if you’re really keen, you can visit ipod.js for a Spotify browser version. The iPod introduced by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2001, was the first MP3 player capable of storing 1,000 songs and came with 10-hour battery life. The tech giant went on to produce multiple versions of the device – including the iPod mini and iPod nano – but many experts have long predicted it was unlikely to remain in production in the long term because of the rise of the iPhone and other smartphones which have cannibalised dedicated music players. The most recent version of the device – the iPod Touch – has not been updated since 2019 and many of its features are now incorporated into other Apple devices and services. Apple said it would continue to sell the Touch, the last remaining generation of the iPod on sale, ‘while supplies last’.
