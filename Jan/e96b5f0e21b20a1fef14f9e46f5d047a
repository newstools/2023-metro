Mikel Arteta has played down injury concerns over Bukayo Saka after Arsenal’s 3-0 victory over Oxford United in the FA Cup on Monday evening. Saka started the FA Cup third-round tie but was forced off with 15 minutes remaining with a suspected knee injury. Arsenal are about to embark on a tough run of fixtures as they play Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday before facing Manchester United and then Manchester City in the FA Cup fourth round. But Arteta has indicated that Saka should be available for Arsenal’s north London derby this weekend, despite his injury on Monday. When asked about Saka’s injury after the game, Arteta told ITV: ‘He’s fine.’ Arteta also praised Fabio Vieira following his two assists in Arsenal’s win over the League One club. ‘He has the quality,’ said Arteta. ‘He is a really creative player and he can decide games in the final third. He made a difference. ‘The contribution of the subs was important as well to change the dynamic of the game.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
