Eight people, including five children, were injured after a Thai navy helicopter dropped flowers and sweets over a National Children’s Day event. The downwash from the aircraft was so powerful it caused a stadium roof to collapse and flattened marquee tents. One woman, Nareerat Khumkana, 58, was even taken to hospital with a broken neck and a cut on her head.. Two other adults and five children were also taken to hospital but were discharged shortly after. Footage shows the crowd scattering as the sweets fall on top of them, with many beginning to scream and cover their heads. The stadium roof is also captured collapsing beneath the weight of the sweets and flowers as the crowd looked on. The local Tha Chang municipal office had asked the navy’s Chantaburi and Trat Border Defence Command to arrange the flyover, the Bangkok Post reported. Mayor Tawatchai Chantakit has confirmed the injured will be fully compensated. The Thai navy has also apologised, and commander-in-chief Admiral Tawatchai Chantakit has ordered the distribution of financial and medical aid. Tha Chang is a municipality in the Tha Muang district in south-eastern Thailand, which is around 150 miles east of Bangkok. Thailand’s National Children’s Day, which was held over the weekend, is celebrated each year with activities and an introduction to how they will help develop their country.
