Chelsea have completed the €40 million (£35.1m) signing of Malo Gusto from Lyon but the 19-year-old will remain on loan with the French club for the rest of the season. Lyon have confirmed that Chelsea will pay €35m (£30.7m) plus a further €5 million (£4.4m) in bonuses for the right-back. Gusto, who completed his medical at Chelsea’s training ground on Saturday, has signed a seven-and-a-half-year contract with the Premier League club. The 19-year-old came through Lyon’s academy and made his professional debut for the French club two years ago. Gusto cemented his position as Lyon’s first-choice right-back last season and has been brought in by Chelsea to provide competition for Reece James on the right side of Graham Potter’s defence. A statement from Chelsea on Sunday read: ‘The exciting 19-year-old right-back has signed a contract at Stamford Bridge to summer 2030 and heads back to France for the remainder of the current campaign to continue with Lyon in Ligue 1, where he has made 15 league appearances. ‘The defender will now continue his impressive progress on loan at the Groupama Stadium before joining up with the Blues in the summer ahead of the new campaign. ‘Chelsea would like to thank Lyon for enabling Malo to take up this new opportunity.’ A statement from Lyon read: ‘Olympique Lyonnais regrets not having been able to keep one of its great hopes trained at the Academy but remains however happy to be able to count on him during this second part of the season.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
