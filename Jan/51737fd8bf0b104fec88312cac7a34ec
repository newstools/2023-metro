Chelsea have officially announced the signing of Mykhailo Mudryk after successfully hijacking Arsenal’s deal for the Shakhtar Donetsk star. The Blues will pay a total of €100m (£88.5m) for the the 22-year-old Ukraine international with €70m (£62m) up front and €30m (£26.5m) in add-ons. Arsenal had appeared to be the favourites to land Mudryk in January and the player was keen on a move to the Emirates but the Gunners were not prepared to pay his price tag while Chelsea also offered him a much more lucrative contract. Mudryk has now penned a eight-and-a-half year deal at Stamford Bridge, keeping him at the west London club until 2032.
