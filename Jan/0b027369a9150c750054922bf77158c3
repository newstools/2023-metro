A teenager has been charged with the murder of a ‘beautiful’ schoolgirl who was stabbed to death in Northumberland. Holly Newton, 15, was named as the victim of Friday’s attack in the Priestpopple area of Hexham. She was discovered injured shortly after 5.10pm and despite the efforts of doctors, later died in hospital. A 16-year-old boy, who was also taken to hospital, suffered non-life-threatening injuries, and is currently in a stable condition. Another 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon. He is scheduled to appear before magistrates in Newcastle on Monday. Northumbria Police believe the suspect and the victim were known to each other, and the murder is being treated as an isolated incident. ‘Holly still had so much left to look forward to in life, and this tragic incident has left her family devastated beyond words,’ a spokesperson for the force said. ‘Our thoughts are with both families involved and their loved ones as we continue to support them in every way we can. ‘The investigation is ongoing, and we would like to thank the people of Hexham – and beyond – who have greatly assisted with our inquiries and shown their support. ‘While our inquiries continue, we do believe all those involved are known to each other and there is no wider risk to the public. ‘Officers will remain in the area over the coming days, and we would encourage anyone with concerns to speak directly with them.’ A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Holly’s family with funeral costs, and has raised more than £4,400 so far.
