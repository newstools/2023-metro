A stunning country estate in Dorset, home to a luxury perfume brand, is up for sale for nearly £4million – and gives the one featured in Emily in Paris a run for its money. On the market for £3.75million, the five-bedroom property has plenty to offer and is dripping in history. Keyneston Mill is currently home to perfume maker Parterre Fragrances and the 46-acre plot boasts gardens packed with plants used to make scents. The early 19th Century property, which used to be a former fruit farm, still has an orchard on the land – as well as a meadow and botanical gardens. There’s even thought to be a mill on the site that’s been there since the 1110s. Inside, the roomy two-bathroom property comes with a sitting room, an office, kitchen/breakfast room and bistro. Period features can be found at every turn too, with flagstone flooring, exposed timbers, decorative fireplaces and more. Estate agent Strutt & Parker, behind the sale, describes the downstairs of the property in the listing, saying: ‘With a stunning, red Aga stove at its heart, the kitchen is fitted with farmhouse-style, wood-fronted cabinetry and two Belfast sinks, with an adjacent utility room which incorporates a cloakroom.’ Feast on more snaps of the gorgeous property below… MORE : Entire tropical island on the market for £376,627 – less than the price of a London flat MORE : Studio flat going for £700 a month – where you can cook from the comfort of your bed MORE : Move over Hoxton: Where to buy a house in 2023… if you’re a Millennial
