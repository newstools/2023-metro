A wanted man who was snapped wearing a Greggs jumper in his mugshot has finally been caught. Shaun Aver, a registered sex offender, was on the run from police after being recalled to prison. He raised eyebrows last month when police appealed for details of his whereabouts – showing him wearing a top emblazoned with the popular bakery firm’s logo. Following his arrest yesterday, police revealed they had been able to catch him because the picture boosted his recognition among members of the public, which allowed them to track him down. Aver, who lives in Bury in Greater Manchester, was known to have links throughout the North West in Bamber Bridge, Chorley, Preston, Blackpool and Lancaster, in Lancashire. During their search, Preston police jokingly posted a series of shots of themselves looking for Aver, 36, outside a local Greggs. The suspect was wanted by authorities after breaching his sex offender requirements, and was eventually apprehended by police at a location in Merseyside. Preston Police said: ‘You may recall us appealing for information to locate Shaun Aver as he was wanted on a recall to Prison. ‘Great news- he was located in Merseyside and has been arrested. ‘Stay tuned for more ground-breaking wanted appeals courtesy of Chorley and South Ribble Task Force. ‘Thanks for all your help and AVER GUDUN!!’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
