There is little sign a stand-off between unions and the government will soon end. A resolution over pay, jobs and conditions looks further away than when industrial action across a number of public sectors was first announced in 2022. Worse yet, more and more union members are voting to escalate the strikes even into February. This is what you need to know about who is on strike today and how it will affect you. Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are again heading to the picket lines today. This will be their third – and last – day of action in January, part of the first ever in history since the creation of the NHS. As required under trade union laws, emergency care is covered from 8am until 8pm. But patients are being warned to expect widespread disruption to services across England. Nurses will also strike on February 6 and 7, with more trusts taking part than in December. More public-transport strikes are taking place across London, with the walkouts primarily affecting buses in south and west. Striking workers will be from depots in Battersea, Beddington, Hayes, Southall, Twickenham and Walworth. More information is available on the TfL website, but commuters are urged to check if their daily route will be affected. Teachers in Scotland are again heading to the picket lines today as part of their 16-day industrial action. Previous walkouts were held in late November – which led to the closure of every state school. But this time around, the strikes will hit certain councils on different days. Members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) will strike in Moray and North Lanarkshire. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
