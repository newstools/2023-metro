Two people have been charged with forcibly triggering a miscarriage and disposing of the body of a baby. Elliot Benham and Sophie Harvey, both 23, were arrested following property searches that took place more than two years ago. They are charged with ‘procuring a poison/noxious thing to cause a miscarriage’, concealing the birth of a child and disposing of a baby’s body. It is believed the offences took place between September 1, 2018 and December 1, 2018. The pair’s arrests follow a long investigation by Gloucestershire police’s Major Crime Investigation Team. Benham, of Swindon in Wiltshire, and Harvey, of Cirencester in Gloucestershire, will both appear at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court on January 5. The ‘Offences Against the Person Act 1861’ states it is a criminal offence to try to cause your own abortion. It is alleged in this case that the pregnancy was past 24 weeks and was not carried out by a registered medical practitioner. In England, abortions are legal up to 24 weeks’ gestation if carried out by a registered medical practitioner, and can be carried out after 24 weeks in very limited circumstances.
