Luke Shaw insists it was a team effort to shut out Erling Haaland’s during Manchester United’s morale-boosting win against Manchester City. United came from behind to beat the Premier League champions at Old Trafford, which put Erik ten Hag’s side to within a point of their city rivals. Despite the return of Lisandro Martinez, Ten Hag opted to partner Raphael Varane with Shaw in the centre of United’s defence. United reduced City to just one shot on target during the 90 minutes and that was Jack Grealish’s headed opener. Haaland is the league’s top scorer with 21 goals to his name so far this term but he barely had a sniff at the Theatre of Dreams. Shaw was given the credit for that given he was directly up against Haaland but the defender says it was a team effort to shutdown the service to the Norway international. ‘We’re very happy, I think we deserved to win,’ said Shaw.‘In the first half, we had a lot of chances and on another day, we take them.‘Extremely proud of the team and everyone out on the field today, they gave everything. ‘Especially the ones that came on and influenced the game, it’s a massive help when they’re ready and can make an impact.’ MORE : Mykhailo Mudryk will be at Stamford Bridge on Sunday after deal agreed MORE : Erik ten Hag confirms Anthony Martial injury after Manchester United’s win against Manchester City For more stories like this, check our sport page.
