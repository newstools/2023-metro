Two suspects charged with the murder of footballer Cody Fisher have been remanded in custody at their first court hearing. The 23-year-old was stabbed to death on the dancefloor of Crane, a nightclub in Digbeth, Birmingham, on Boxing Day. Kami Carpenter, 21, and Remy Gordon, 22, were charged with his murder, police confirmed on Saturday. Both pleaded not guilty to a linked charge of affray, alleged to have taken place on December 26 as well. Following a four-minute hearing before two magistrates, they were ordered to reappear before a judge at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday. West Midlands Police said the victim was fatally stabbed on the dancefloor of the nightclub, which had its licence suspended for 28 days on Friday. Mr Fisher, who played for Stratford Town FC, was attacked at about 11.45pm while on a night out with friends. Officers recovered a knife from the scene, and a post-mortem examination confirmed he died of the stab wound. His girlfriend Jess Chatwin paid tribute to him with a message on Twitter the day after he died. She wrote: ‘You didn’t deserve any of this. I’m so sorry this has happened to you my baby please come home. I love you forever Cody Fisher.’ A statement published by the police and attributed to Mr Fisher’s family said: ‘They have broken our hearts; I have lost my best friend. ‘My family and I are asking for privacy and respectfulness at this heart-breaking time.’ A further hearing was also set for Monday, January 30.
