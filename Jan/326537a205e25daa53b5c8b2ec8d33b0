This is the hilarious moment a dog appears to be making a desperate bid for freedom. Angel the Japanese Akita cross was filmed chewing an enormous hole in his owner’s front door after apparently ripping the letterbox clean off. The naughty dog tears chunks out of the uPVC door before poking his head through the hole in Kelty, Fife. ‘Walking out your dad’s to see dog literally eat through a door,’ the video’s caption on TikTok read. Unsurprisingly, the clip soon went viral, prompting discussion about why the dog was acting so oddly. Sara-Jayne Bell wrote: ‘Awww my old boy done this sort of thing for years. ‘I had to take him everywhere with me until I got another dog. Separation anxiety most likely.’ Donna Ali said: ‘Bless him, he is desperate to get out. Someone needs to check on the residents.’ But owner Suzanne Connelly explained that Angel is really just ‘a big softy’. She told STV News: ‘Animal welfare came out to check over him, but they left after they realised he came from a loving home. ‘The woman actually just called him a naughty dog. We all just love him so much so we can’t punish him for that. ‘Even if it is going to cost us £300 for a new door. We are just laughing about it really.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
