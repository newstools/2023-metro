The Riverdance performer, 64, has recently undergone treatment for the disease and is being looked after by an ‘excellent team of doctors’. A statement shared on Michael’s Instagram page confirmed the news. It read: ‘Dear friends, we have something personal to share, Michael Flatley has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. ‘He has undergone surgery and is in the care of an excellent team of doctors. No further comments will be made at this time. We ask only for your prayers and well wishes. Thank you. 🙏🏻 Teamlord’ Many fans were quick to offer Michael their well wishes after learning about his health battle. ‘Dear Michael! I wish you a lot of strength and energy for this difficult time! Get well soon! 💙’ penned one. Echoing a similar sentiment, another said: ‘So sorry to be reading this news. Michael you’re a fighter, you can beat this sending lots of love and prayers to you and your family.’ A third wrote: ‘God bless you, Michael. I hope that you make a full recovery.’ Michael was catapulted to fame in the Irish dancing production Riverdance, which was first performed as a break in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1994. He then went on to create the megahit stage show Lord Of The Dance. Over the years, he has danced for more than 60million people in 60 countries. Besides his dancing career, Michael has also tried his hand at filmmaking. In 2019, he wrote, directed, financed, and starred in the spy film Blackbird, which was set in the UK, Ireland, and Barbados. Speaking to BBC Breakfast last year, Michael revealed he was told to forget forging a path within the movie industry. At the time, he said: ‘And I’ll tell you what, the big motivation for me making Blackbird is all the people that said “impossible, you can’t do it. You can’t be an actor – you’re a dancer.” I mean, I’ve heard it till I’m blue in the face and you just have to go for it.’
