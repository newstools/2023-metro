Across six decades, Steven Spielberg has given us era-defining movies about sharks, aliens and dinosaurs with a few spies, soldiers and Nazis in between. Yet the multi-Oscar-winning legend has resisted the lure of autobiography – until now. The most commercially successful director of all time earned this indulgence. Spielberg, now aged 76, waited until his parents had died before reimagining their story as the loving, middle-class Jewish family in The Fabelmans. Mum Mitzi (Michelle Williams) and boffin-y dad Burt (Paul Dano) take son Sammy (Mateo Zoryan Francis-Deford and later Gabriel LaBelle) to the cinema to watch The Greatest Show On Earth. The 11-year-old is left traumatised by the climactic train crash. He obsessively recreates it with his train set and home videos the smash-ups as a way of controlling his fear. This is a coming-of-age portrait of the artist as a young man and a love letter to the power of movies to entertain and move us. But it’s a more gracious act of memoir than that. Spielberg reassesses his mother’s thwarted artistic ambition and her relationship with his jovial ‘Uncle’ Benny (Seth Rogen). He also gets revenge on the high-school jocks who literally kicked sand in his face. What demands does talent place on you? What does happiness look like? Spielberg’s gift is to find the universal soul in any story. This is a movie so masterfully made, you can glide along its surface without quite realising all it’s asking of you. The Fabelmans has, unsurprisingly, received seven nominations for this year’s Oscars, including a best actress nod for Williams and a best director nod for Spielberg himself. 12A.
