A man questioned over a shooting at a church in Euston, central London, has been bailed. Metropolitan Police officers arrested the 22-year-old on suspicion of attempted murder after the drive-by attack outside St Aloysius Church on Phoenix Road. He was stopped in Cricklewood Lane in Barnet shortly after 4pm on Sunday, and had been taken into custody for questioning. But he has now been bailed pending further inquiries to a date in mid-February. Six people who had been attending a memorial service in the church were hit in the shooting on Saturday afternoon. A seven-year-old girl who was hospitalised with life-threatening injuries remains in a serious but stable condition, the force said. Three women, aged 48, 54 and 41, were taken to a central London hospital where their injuries were assessed as non-life threatening. A fourth woman, aged 21, was also rushed to hospital, but her condition has been assessed as non life-threatening. A 12-year-old girl who suffered leg injuries is expected to make a full recovery. Police said shotgun pellets were fired from a black Toyota C-HR at about 1.30pm before it drove off. Mourners had reportedly left the church to release white doves when the incident happened. Many ran for their lives, seeking shelter inside the building, when bullets started flying. The shooting took place after a memorial service was held for 20-year-old Sara Sanchez and her mother, Fresia Calderon, who had died within a month of one another in November. Got a story?
