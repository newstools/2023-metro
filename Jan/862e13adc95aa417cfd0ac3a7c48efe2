Cristiano Ronaldo’s first appearance after moving to Saudi Arabia could be for an exhibition team in a friendly against Paris Saint-Germain, rather than for new club Al Nassr. PSG have announced that they will be in Riyadh on 19 January to take on an all-star XI comprised of players from top Saudi side Al Hilal and Al Nassr. Ronaldo is yet to play his first game for Al Nassr as he is serving an FA suspension from his time in England and his new manager has confirmed that his debut in Saudi Arabia will be in the exhibition friendly. ‘It (his debut) won’t be with the Al Nassr jersey. It will be a mix between Al Hilal and Al Nassr,’ said Rudi Garcia. ‘As the coach of Al Nassr, I cannot be happy with this match. For development, to see PSG, to see the great Parisian players, indeed it is a good thing. But we have a championship game three days later. ‘In terms of scheduling, it could have been better thought out. But it’s not a big deal… We are in the lead, we are happy. It is a difficult championship to win, but we intend to do it.’ Al Nassr are playing in the league before that friendly, at Al Shabab, but Ronaldo remains suspended for that game between the top two sides in the table. If all goes to plan from now then Ronaldo is likely to play his first Al Nassr game on 22 January at home against Al Ittifaq. While PSG have not announced a squad to travel to Saudi Arabia, it could be that Ronaldo plays his first game since moving to the country against old rival Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.
