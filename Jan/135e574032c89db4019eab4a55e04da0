Proving you can rock a bump in a ballgown, pregnant actresses Hilary Swank and Kaley Cuoco were two celebs that wowed with their outfits. Hilary, 48, posed for pictures in a stunning forest green Prada dress featuring long, trailing ribbons, accessorised with dazzling drop earrings and simple black pumps. Despite being 27 weeks along (with twins!) the two-time Oscar winner glowed in the elegant ensemble. Meanwhile, Big Bang Theory star Kaley, 37, went for a pastel vibe, in a pale lilac Vera Wang Haute Couture gown dotted with gems. The empire line and floaty chiffon fabric gave a Regency feel to the look, but was chosen by the designer to ‘accommodate [Kaley’s] stage of pregnancy, because comfort was a major factor for her.’ Unfortunately, most of us don’t have world-renowned fashion houses to call upon before big events – and finding formal pieces that fit well and make you feel ‘dressed up’ while pregnant can be tricky. Maternity wear has a slouchy, somewhat frumpy image. But if you’ve got an occasion to get glammed up for, you can find showstopping dresses and separates that combine comfort with style. We’ve picked our favourite maternity wear buys to get you red carpet ready when you’re expecting. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
