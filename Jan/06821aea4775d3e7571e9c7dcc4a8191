Jeremy Renner has shared an image from his hospital bed as he spoke out for the first time since his horrific snow plowing accident. The Marvel actor has thanked fans for their ‘kind words’ two days after he was seriously injured in an accident near his US home. Jeremy was airlifted to hospital on Sunday after suffering ‘blunt chest trauma and orthopaedic injuries’ in an accident near the Mount Rose Highway, which links Lake Tahoe and south Reno, straddling the Nevada-California border. In a shot from his hospital bed, the Hawkeye star was seen with a bruised eye and red scrapes down his cheek as he smiled. He was wearing a hospital gown and had an oxygen tube attached to his nose. He wrote: ‘Thank you all for your kind words. 🙏. ‘Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all. [SIC].’ The actor suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopaedic injuries after the ‘weather-related’ accident, with the star admitted to hospital in a critical but stable condition. Reps later confirmed Jeremy, 51, underwent surgery and remained in the intensive care unit as of yesterday. In a statement to Metro.co.uk, they said: ‘We can confirm that Jeremy has suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopaedic injuries and has undergone surgery today, January 2nd 2023. ‘He has returned from surgery and remains in the intensive care unit in critical but stable condition.’ It added: ‘Jeremy’s family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible doctors and nurses looking after him, Truckee Meadows Fire and Rescue, Washoe County Sheriff, Reno City Mayor Hillary Schieve and the Carano and Murdock families. ‘They are also tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans.’ It was earlier reported Jeremy lost a ‘serious amount of blood’ in the horrific accident. According to reports, he was ploughing the road near his Tahoe home after a heavy snow fall, so that his family could leave the property. A neighbour told TMZ that the machine accidentally ran over one of his legs, leading to serious blood loss and a quick-thinking local is thought to have applied a tourniquet until the paramedics arrived on the scene and took him to safety. Video footage obtained by the outlet showed the helicopter taking off to get the star urgent medical attention. Following news of Jeremy’s accident, the Washoe County Sheriff said in a statement that it responded to a ‘traumatic injury’ in the Mt. Rose Highway area in Reno, Nevada before it coordinated with other agencies to arrange for the flight to the hospital. The sheriff noted ‘Mr. Renner was the only involved party’ and added the office was investigating the incident. The area around Lake Tahoe saw a winter storm hit on New Year’s Eve, with local press reporting 35,000 homes near across Northern Nevada’s Washoe, Carson, Douglas, Storey and Lyon counties were without power due to the weather. The Hawkeye favourite recently spoke of the cold conditions at his ranch, tweeting in December: ‘Lake Tahoe snowfall is no joke.’ In recent social media posts, Jeremy shared his excitement ahead of his new show, a reality series for Disney Plus this year with the working title of Rennervations.
