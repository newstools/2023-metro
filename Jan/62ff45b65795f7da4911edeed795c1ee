Former Premier League official Keith Hackett has slammed Mikel Arteta’s ‘totally unacceptable’ behaviour during Arsenal’s 0-0 draw with Newcastle United on Tuesday evening. The Gunners failed to win at home for the first time in the Premier League this season as they were frustrated by Eddie Howe’s side at the Emirates Stadium. Arteta was furious on the touchline in the closing stages of the game as he felt Arsenal were denied a penalty after the ball struck Jacob Murphy’s arm from Granit Xhaka’s cross. Arsenal were also unhappy earlier in the second half after VAR did not intervene when Dan Burn pulled Gabriel’s shirt inside the box. Arteta made his feelings clear on the side of the pitch and Hackett, the former head of the PGMOL, believes the Arsenal manager should have been sent off by referee Andy Madley. In his response to a video of Arteta’s antics on the touchline during the game, Hackett wrote on Twitter: ‘Totally unacceptable behaviour. Get a grip and start to do it the Arsenal way. ‘Disappointing that he was not shown a red and sent to the director’s box.’ Arteta, meanwhile, defended his actions and his bust-up with Howe on the touchline. ‘It’s a football match, it’s competitive, the way we play, the way they play,’ Arteta said when asked about the row with Howe. ‘We are close in the table and it’s like this. It’s the beauty of this league.’ When asked about Arsenal’s penalty claims, Arteta said: ‘There were two scandalous penalties. ‘Both of them. It’s not particular. It’s a penalty or not a penalty and it’s both penalties.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
