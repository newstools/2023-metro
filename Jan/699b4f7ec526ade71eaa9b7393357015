A plaque has been unveiled to honour the ‘hero’ who died after jumping into the Thames to try and save a drowning woman. Folajimi Olubunmi-Adewole was walking home from work when he spotted the woman struggling in the water and heard her cries. ‘Jimi’ told his friend Bernard Kosia ‘I have to save her’ and jumped in along with another passer-by. Jimi and Joaquin Garcia, who had heard the commotion, went to the side of the river and removed their clothes, counted to three, and entered the water. The woman and Garcia were successfully pulled out of the water, but Olubunmi-Adewole was lost in the river. His body was discovered near London Bridge six hours later. The plaque was unveiled by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, at the point on the Thames where Jimi jumped in. Mr Khan, who was joined by Olubunmi-Adewole’s grieving parents Michael and Olasunkanmi, said: ‘Jimi was a hero. His story should be told again and again and again. ‘Strength, selflessness, courage, humility, bravery, all those things are bottled up in this one man Jimi. ‘It’s so important this plaque is here. Because his memory and spirit must live on. He was the best of us.’ In 2021, Olubunmi-Adewole was walking home after a night shift and heard a woman crying out from the Thames. Flowers have been laid at the plaque in Cathedral Square after its unveiling, with tributes being paid by Mr Olubunmi-Adewole’s family. Jimi’s brother Bolaji Olubunmi-Adewole said: ‘We no longer feel sorry. Today we are celebrating life now. ‘We are grateful for this recognition of Folajimi. Very big thank you to Living Bankside, to Southwark Cathedral, the Mayor of London for making this happen.’ MORE : Sadiq Khan accuses Priti Patel of stitch up over ‘biased’ Met Police report MORE : Man, 40, dies after being hit by a bus that failed to stop in west London
