A man has been charged with murder after human remains were discovered in a pond in Essex. Lee Clark, 52, is accused of killing 59-year-old Phillip Lewis, whose remains were found submerged in Oakwood Pond, Harlow, on New Year’s Eve. Clark, from Harlow, was arrested on suspicion of murder last week and is due to appear at Colchester magistrates’ court today. A second man, aged 23, who was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, has been released on bail until March while inquiries continue. Police said Mr Lewis’s remains were likely to have been in the pond for weeks before they were spotted by a dog walker. Det Supt Rob Kirby, head of Essex major crime, said the charge represented a ‘significant stage’ in the investigation. But he urged anyone who had come into contact with Mr Lewis – known as ‘Scottish Phil’ – since November 1 to come forward. ‘Over the last eight days, we have had a team of dedicated detectives and forensic experts who have pieced together what we believe to be the circumstances around Phillip’s death,’ said Mr Kirby. ‘Of course, that work does not stop at the point of charge and, in many ways, this is still the beginning of complex investigation into the death of a 59-year-old man who was a son and a friend.’ Police are continuing to drain the pond – a popular angling spot – to allow them to investigate the scene. They also want to speak to anyone who regularly visits the area. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
