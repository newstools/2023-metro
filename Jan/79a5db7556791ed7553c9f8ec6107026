A total of 7.19 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment at the end of November – a light drop from record-high in NHS history. This is down slightly from 7.21 million in October, which was the highest number since records began in August 2007. According to NHS England data, an estimated 406,575 patients had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start their treatment at the end of November. This is down from 410,983 at the end of October and is the first month-on-month fall since February last year. Tories have set the ambition of eliminating all waits of more than a year by March 2025. But with the NHS experiencing some of the most severe pressures in its 70-year history, and nurses and ambulance staff on strike, this seems unlikely. The figures shared by the health service are just a snapshot of the crisis it is experiencing as we enter 2023. Desperate families have been sharing horror stories of waiting for ambulances, to be admitted in A&E and for treatment. A decade of underfunding, staff shortages and a workforce exhausted by Covid has led the national health service to breaking point. Some 1,423 people are estimated to have been waiting more than two years at the end of November. This is again down slightly from 1,907 at the end of October and is well below the peak of 23,778 in January 2022. The government and NHS England set the ambition to eliminate all waits of more than two years by last July, except when it is the patient’s choice or for complex cases requiring specialist treatment.
