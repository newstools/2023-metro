A houseboat weighed down by beer bottles and Carling cans has sunk in Salford, Greater Manchester. Firefighters used an underwater camera to inspect the inside of the boat and discovered the array of alcoholic beverages. They also determined that no-one had been inside at the time of the sinking. Emergency services had made their way to the water, by the Dutton Arms pub on the Bridgewater Canal in Eccles, on Friday afternoon. Police reportedly smashed one of the windows to ensure nobody was inside. A box of Carling lager, a pair of old trainers and bottles of beer were strewn inside the houseboat. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said: ‘Just before 12.30pm on Friday afternoon (27th January), two fire engines from Salford central fire station along with the Technical Rescue Unit from Ashton and the Water Incident Unit from Eccles were called to reports of a submerged boat in Bridgewater Canal, Eccles. ‘The crews arrived quickly at scene. Firefighters used an underwater camera, Tirfor and water rescue equipment to search the houseboat.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
