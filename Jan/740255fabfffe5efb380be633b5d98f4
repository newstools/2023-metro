An international dog show has been axed after it was exposed for extreme breeding. The American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC) UK show was due to be held at the Coventry Building Society Arena on February 11. But the BBC discovered dogs at a previous event being showcased with cropped ears and extremely muscular physiques, prompting the upcoming show to be cancelled. It has been illegal to cut the top bit of skin off a dog’s ear in this country since 2006. Yet it’s still done with certain breeds, including the American bully, to make their ears look more upright. Footage from the prior event shows several dogs with cropped ears getting rewarded by judges. One of the show’s judges, Aaron Lee, was also busted after two 10-week-old American bully puppies were discovered in a cage at his home with freshly cropped ears. After the BBC report was aired on Panorama on Monday, the Coventry Building Society Arena confirmed it would no longer host the show at its venue. The RSPCA said it was concerned about the ‘deliberate mutilation’ of animals and stressed it was only being done for aesthetic purposes. The procedure is painful and can affect a dog’s hearing and ability to communicate. It can also cause emotional trauma. Because the practice is illegal, owners often turn to unqualified people to perform the surgery. This makes the whole situation especially dangerous for dogs who risk infection and sometimes even death. The BBC also spoke to animal welfare activists who showed the effects of extreme breeding. One dog was seen with his legs looking like they had been ‘put on back to front’ and struggling to walk. This happens when people unethically breed dogs to try and exaggerate their physicals features. Aaron Lee would not comment to the BBC.
