When it comes to culinary hallmarks, the UK is perhaps best-known for its fish and chip offering – along with roast dinners and scones, of course. And customers are flocking to one chippy in particular to sample the goods. The Chip Inn in Huthwaite, Nottingham, claims it serves the UK’s ‘largest portion’ of fish and chips – weighing a staggering 1st 4lbs (that’s just over 8kg). The 20-inch Codfather serving is made up of four battered cods, three portions of chips, eight sausages, four fish cakes and 10 sauces. This hefty portion will set you back £40 and the team at The Chip Inn even have to tape the box to stop the food bursting out. Megann Altinoz, 42, who owns the shop with husband Erdal, 45, said: ‘I haven’t seen another one that big. People compete for the biggest kebab but not fish and chips. ‘It’s hard to describe how heavy the boxes are but the 20-inch ones are a struggle to lift when they’re ready. I have to get some someone to help me lift it.’ Customers have been travelling to the chippy from all over the country to try the enormous portion – with some coming from even further afield. Megann added: ‘We’ve had people come from the USA. They were travelling to London and came to our shop because they had heard about it online. ‘It’s amazing that people from around the world know us because of our boxes. We definitely have American-style portions.’ The idea to super-size portions initially came after a customer asked to put a kebab in a pizza box. After sharing a video of this larger potion on social media, the team found they were inundated with visitors. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
