A former Playboy model has been jailed for her role in the murder of her 71-year-old ‘sugar daddy’ after he stopped paying her $3,200 rent. Kelsey Turner and her then-boyfriend, Jon Kennison, beat Dr Thomas Burchard to death and stuffed his body in the boot of her car, prosecutors said. The psychiatrist’s decomposing body was found in the abandoned vehicle outside Las Vegas, near Lake Mead, in March 2019. Detectives determined he had been bludgeoned with a blunt instrument, likely a baseball bat. Police reports showed Dr Burchard had been helping Turner pay her bills for two years before his death. However, Judy Earp, who was Dr Burchard’s fiancé at the time, claims he had given Turner around $300,000 (£246,000) to be her ‘sugar daddy’. Turner, 29, and Kennison, were later arrested along with their roommate Diana Pena. Kennison pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy and was handed an 18 to 45-year sentence in July last year. Pena admitted being an accessory to murder in June 2019 after helping to clean the crime scene and fleeing the state with the couple. Turner, who posed for the likes of Maxim and Playboy Italia, entered an Alford plea in November, meaning she could maintain her innocence while admitting prosecutors had enough evidence to prove her guilt. It also meant she could avoid a trial and was given a lesser sentence of 10 to 25 years for second-degree murder on Tuesday. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
