Stacey Dooley has announced she has given birth to a baby girl with Strictly Come Dancing star Kevin Clifton. The presenter shared a sweet picture of an envelope titled ‘Minnie’s parents’, on Instagram revealing the adorable name. She wrote: ‘Our Daughter is here. ‘My little masterpiece! ‘I’m COMPLETELY OBSESSED.’ The 35-year-old signed off: ‘Love you Minnie, Love you Kev x’ Stacey and Kevin, 39, revealed they were expecting their first child together in August, with the presenter saying she ‘doesn’t take it for granted’. Making the happy announcement, the couple shared a picture of Stacey’s baby bump, as she wrote on Instagram ‘Gaaaaaaang….. We are having a baby! 🤪So bloody delighted. Kev, you’re magic, I love youuuu.’ Shortly after, she spoke about not taking the exciting news for ‘granted’. Appearing on The One Show, she said: ‘I can’t quite believe it. I’m delighted actually, I feel really lucky’. ‘Because I’m 35, so you never sort of take it for granted. But I can’t quite believe I’m going to be in charge of a little human being.’ After announcing that they’d given birth on Tuesday, the couple’s post was flooded with congratulatory messages. Strictly pro Nancy Xu penned: ‘😍😍😍😍😍yeahhhhhhhh’ while Great British Bake Off winner Candice Brown wrote: ‘Yayyyyyyyy so many congratulations’. Presenter Dermot O’Leary wrote: ‘Huge congrats xx’ as Ashley Roberts echoed: ‘Yay!!!! Congrats! Welcome Miss Minnie’ Stacey and Kevin, who used to appear as a professional on Strictly, first met when they were paired up on the show in 2018. They went all the way to victory, nabbing the Glitterball trophy in the final. The presenter and documentary maker split from boyfriend Sam Tucknott in early 2019, and was later confirmed to be dating Kevin. They’ve kept their relationship mostly out of the spotlight since, as Stacey previously recalled the attention surrounding their relationship when they first started dating Kevin and she had to adjust to the interest in their personal lives. Speaking on Loose Women, she said: ‘I did [struggle] initially, I did at the start. I didn’t realise there would be such an interest, particularly with who I fancy and who I’m dating. I thought that was dull for everyone else. ‘Now, Kev and I have been together for two years, so no one’s really that fussed anymore, and we’re so dull!’ Got a story?
