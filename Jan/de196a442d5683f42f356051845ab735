Rylan Clark has shown his support for Eamonn Holmes as the TV presenter recovers from his back surgery – and he’s making him laugh along the way too. The This Morning host, 63, was off screens for several months following his medical procedure, and only recently returned to GB News. He underwent the op in the hopes that it would allow him to live life without constant pain, having been open with his followers on social media about his chronic health struggles. As part of his recovery, Eamonn is relying on crutches to get him around – and he has a very handy stair lift at home as well. Of course, friend Rylan had to test it out, and shared a hilarious video to Instagram as he joked that Eamonn should start charging a fee for people to have a ride. With Eamonn’s wife Ruth Langsford, 62, behind the camera, she urged Rylan, 34, not to break the (probably very expensive) piece of equipment. ‘Oh, this is great!’, Rylan said as he gave a royal wave while travelling down the posh staircase in style. ‘Excuse me, are you Rylan? Can I have your autograph?’, Loose Woman Ruth joked, unable to contain her laughter. ‘Can I just say, I know you’ve been through it, dad, but you’ve got an easy life here!’, Rylan joked with Eamonn. The Irish TV star then joked that his house was like a ‘fun fair’, hailing it ‘The Fun Palace.’ ‘Honestly, you could rent this out!’, the Celebrity Big Brother winner quipped. The former X Factor star captioned his cheeky video: ‘Well someone had to go and check out the tech…. @eamonnholmes . Good to see you on the mend ♥️♥️♥️’ Appreciative of the company, Eamonn commented: ‘Welcome to The Fun Palace ! Great night my friend 👏👏👏👏👏’ ‘This made me cry laughing!’, The One Show presenter Alex Jones also wrote, with Eamonn replying to her: ‘And We haven’t even told u about the reclining chair breaking down with me in it !!!!😂’ Sounds like it was a laugh a minute round Ruth and Eamonn’s place on Sunday night! The broadcaster shared his own snap from their catch-up, with himself and Rylan sitting on the couch, each holding a crutch. ‘Look who called in to see me today. What a surprise !!!’, he wrote. ‘Better than medicine u r Rylan my friend . Gosh we laughed and laughed . 😆😆😆😆’ Eamonn has made no secret of his health woes, revealing in 2021 that his mobility issues were impacting his family’s everyday life. He told The Sun: ‘I don’t walk — it’s more of a wobble. It has been very difficult this year. My problem is a trapped sciatic nerve, but I don’t even know quite how it initially happened. ‘For months now I haven’t been able to walk, sometimes at all, and it has really taken its toll on everyone around me too. I can’t bend down to pick things up so Ruth ends up having to wait on me, and I know my sons particularly are a bit embarrassed by the way I move around.’ Got a story?
