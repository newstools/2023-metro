You’re probably already familiar with the ‘vanilla girl aesthetic’ – AKA, all about comfort, clean lines and flawless minimalism. Now, a brand new beauty trend is playing into this theme, too. ‘Vanilla French nails’ are currently trending and the design is all about simplicity with style – offering a 2023 take on a classic mani. Coined by nail artist Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola), this look involves opting for more subtle shades as a base and a more muted off-white tip – rather than a striking, traditional French one. Following on from doughnut and chrome nails, the vanilla mani is all about embodying a neutral palette (think beige, cream and, naturally, vanilla) – after a bold and bright festive period. The look has already been spotted on the likes of Kylie Jenner and Adele – so has the A-list seal of approval. To achieve it, Zola uses two OPI shades. She starts with Put It In Neutral for the nail bed to achieve a ‘your own but better’ effect, followed by Funny Bunny on the tips. However, she stresses that if you have pink undertones, OPI’s Bubble Bath would be a great base, too. Simply do two coats of the base colour, followed by two layers of the tip shade and lock it all in place with a top coat. Do you have a story to share?
