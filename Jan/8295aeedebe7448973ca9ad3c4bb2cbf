Teachers and bin workers are going on strike today in a bid for better pay and working conditions. It is the second week pupils in Scotland have missed out on lessons as their teachers join the picket line, with the walkout continuing until February 6. Bin workers in Liverpool have also begun strike action this week, which will last until Saturday. In the last month, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers, rail workers, taxi drivers, civil servants, barristers and bus drivers have all taken industrial action. Two of Scotland’s local authority areas have walked out each day in the Educational Institute of Scotland’s (EIS) bid for a 10% pay rise. Teaching unions rejected a 5% pay increase, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. Scotland’s education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said the 10% figure is unaffordable. Previous walkouts held in November 2022 and on January 10 and 11 meant every mainland school in the country closed its doors. EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said there was ‘growing frustration’ from teachers as previous talks failed to result in an improved pay offer. She said: ‘Morale is high but, obviously, there’s a growing frustration at the lack of urgency being shown by the Scottish government and Cosla to settle this dispute. ‘[Teachers] are having to take strike action in freezing temperatures. This is not action that they should be having to take, it’s simply to achieve a fair pay settlement.’ Liverpool Streetscene Services Ltd (LSSL) workers who are members of Unite union which will be striking for ‘fair pay’. The union said more than 70 workers who work in refuse collection, street cleaning and parks will take to the picket line. Strikers are seeking a 4% pay rise, and an additional £1,000 to offset the cost of living crisis. A LSSL spokesman said it was ‘surprised and disappointed’ at the move.
