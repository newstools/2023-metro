A polar bear that attacked and killed a boy and a woman has been shot dead. State troopers in Alaska received a report of the attack at 2.30pm on Tuesday in Wales, on the western tip of the Seward Peninsula, local media reported. ‘Initial reports indicate that a polar bear had entered the community and had chased multiple residents,’ troopers wrote. ‘The bear fatally attacked an adult female and juvenile male.’ The names of the two victims have not yet been released and troopers are working to inform family members. They along with the State Department of Fish and Game are planning to travel to Wales once weather makes it possible. Another woman and her dog were attacked by a massive bear in September in Oregon. She was outside behind her home when the creature ran at her and attacked, causing non life-threatening injuries to her left arm and left leg. According to the police, the dog helped its owner fend off the bear who eventually ran away. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
