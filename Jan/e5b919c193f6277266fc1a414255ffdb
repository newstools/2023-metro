A man melted hearts after he proposed to his girlfriend on a busy flight. The romantic passenger secreted boarded the same Air India jet as his lover without telling her. She was travelling from London to Mumbai, via Hyderabad in India, when her partner boarded the plane at the connecting airport. It’s also worth pointing out the proposal was agreed by the airline in advance to prevent any obstacles. In a video of the event, the young man approaches his partner while clutching a pink sign, as she is seen in a window seat, looking outside. He finds his partner’s seat on the busy flight and holds aloft the sign in front of other stunned passengers. Shocked, the young woman reads the words on the sign, which also includes several photos of the couple at different stages of their relationship. ‘I could walk forever and a mile with you. Would you like to walk with me?’ says the sign. Passengers applaud joyfully as the woman meets the man on the aisle, as he drops to one knee. In the clip, onlookers gasp as he opens a ring box in front of his trembling partner, and is seen placing the ring on her finger. Air India said the man boarded the flight in Hyderabad for the final stretch of the journey to Mumbai. ‘My niece approached me and said that his friend wants to propose to his soon-to-be fiancée inside the aircraft, who was travelling on the flight,’ says the airline spokesperson. ‘Nothing was required from Air India but only to allow him to propose. ‘I just liaised with the crew, and our captains made it happen without disturbing passengers – in a smooth manner.’ Do you have a story to share?
