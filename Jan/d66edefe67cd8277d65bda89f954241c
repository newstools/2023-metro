This is the horrifying moment a circus trainer is attacked by a tiger during a live performance. The enormous cat was filmed sinking its teeth into the animal tamer in Leece, Italy, as the crowd gasps in shock behind the cage. Ivan Orfei, 31, had been concentrating on another cat sat on a giant metal ring, when the second tiger sneaks up and pounces on his leg. He shrieks in pain and struggles to get free but the tiger jumps on his back and tries to bite his neck, seemingly trying to finish off his prey. Ivan narrowly escapes the tigerâ€™s death clutch thanks to his assistant beating it with a table, allowing him to limp away. After the mauling, Ivan was rushed to the emergency department of Vito Fazzi Hospital with deep wounds to his neck and leg. His injuries are serious but not life threatening and he remains in hospital for treatment. An investigation is now underway and the tiger will be seen by a vet.
