Looking for a rental opportunity in the capital? Do you think traditional, rectangular beds are a passé snooze-fest? Well, this fourth-floor walk-up could be the apartment for you. This studio flat in Farringdon, which is on the market for £1,300, is triangular and too small to fit a full-sized bed and a sofa inside. It has a combined lounge, sleeping, and kitchen area with photos showing a small triangle-shaped bed nestled into the only free and very pointy corner of the room. Situated in a converted former warehouse, thankfully it comes furnished. You might be spending over a grand a month to cook in the same room you sleep in, but at least you won’t have to source your own three-pointed bed. Based on the floor plan, the interestingly-angled mattress seems to be laid on top of a cupboard. And it’s available immediately, you lucky thing. Prospective tenants need to put down a £1,500 deposit, and no pets are allowed. It’s being let by OpenRent. The listing reads: ‘Very light studio flat in a super convenient location. ‘Top floor of this very popular warehouse conversion. Please note this flat is a walk-up four floors. ‘The building is adjacent to Farringdon station, therefore the railway runs directly behind the building. ‘Electric heating, washer dryer, compact kitchen, double-glazed, wood floor, new bathroom ‘Available immediately.
