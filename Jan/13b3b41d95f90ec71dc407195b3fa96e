A lioness ‘died instantly’ after being killed by another lion at a safari park in Wiltshire. Longleat Safari Park, a popular attraction for families, allows guests to drive through enclosures to see various animals. But cars were barred from entering one area on New Year’s Day, due to an ‘unknown major incident’. Longleat Safari Park has since confirmed that this was due to the death of a lioness. A spokesperson said: ‘This weekend (1st January 2023) saw one of the lionesses at Longleat sadly killed by another lion. ‘This kind of incident is very rare but can naturally occur amongst apex predators. ‘It happened incredibly quickly, with the lioness dying almost instantly. ‘Our professional keepers were immediately on the scene, however the timescales involved meant there was no possibility of intervention. ‘There was no risk to guests.’ On New Year’s Day, one guest wrote on social media that they could see a lioness not moving on the ground.
