An airplane carrying 72 people has crashed near an airport in central Nepal. Footage shared on Twitter allegedly shows the domestic Yeti Airlines flight from Kathmandu moments before it crashed on landing, catching fire. At least 67 bodies have already been recovered from the site in the tourist town of Pokhara, and there are fears no survivors will be found. Pictures posted on social media show plumes of smoke rising from the site of the crash. It has been described as the Himalayan country’s worst air incident in almost five years. Nepal army spokesperson, Krishna Bhandari, stressed: ‘We expect to recover more bodies. The plane has broken into pieces.’ A rescue operation is underway near Pokhara International Airport, where workers were trying to put out the fire. Nepalese soldiers have been drafted to help, while residents have also rushed to the site. ‘Rescue operations are on,’ said Jagannath Niroula, spokesperson for Nepal’s civil aviation authority. ‘Weather was clear.’ It was not immediately clear what caused the plane to crash, but the mountainous region has a long history of such incidents. After news of the crash broke the country’s prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, called an emergency cabinet meeting. Pokhara is located 125 miles west of Kathmandu, and is the gateway to the Annapurna Circuit, a popular hiking trail in the Himalayas. As such, the town is a popular destination for thousands of tourists every year. Of the passengers on board of the domestic flight, 53 are said to be Nepalese. There were also five from India, four from Russia and two from Korea on the plane. There was also one passenger each from Ireland, Australia, Argentina and France among others.
