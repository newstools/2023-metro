An artist’s impression has been released of an unidentified man whose body was pulled from a canal earlier this month. West Yorkshire Police have confirmed that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man’s death in Leeds. But they are nonetheless keen to identify him. Police have revealed that the man was bald, with stubble around his mouth and white hair on the sides of his head. He carried a set of keys with a red keyring. When the man was found in the canal he was wearing a beige jacket and beige trousers, a green and brown checked shirt, as well as a blue diamond pattern jumper, brown shoes and a beige scarf and gloves. Detective chief inspector James Entwistle from West Yorkshire Police said: ‘We believe the artist’s impression is a good likeness of the man and, alongside his clothing and personal items, we are hoping someone will recognise him. ‘We are keen to identify him to support to the Coronial process and to trace any next of kin there may be.’ Anyone who recognises the man is asked to contact police on 101.
