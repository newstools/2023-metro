If you were able to name a cocktail more unholy than Diet Coke and champagne, we’d be impressed. And yet, Tom Hanks, American national treasure, not only admitted to being the one responsible for creating and naming this concoction but also said it’s ‘delicious’ to boot. Diet Cokagne (yes, we know what that sounds like when you say it out loud, Tom has made that joke already) was apparently invented during this last holiday season. During an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the actor explained that, rather than being much of a drinker, Tom usually opts for a humble Diet Coke. But one festive night, when champagne was being passed around, Tom decided to indulge, asking the server to add just a shot of champers to his Coke. ‘Everybody said, “you are insane”,’ the Oscar-winner recalled. ‘I said, “well, I may be insane, but I want to celebrate the season.” ‘So I had a sip of this, and Stephen, it was delicious.’ Yes, really. The host promptly brought out a pre-prepared bottle, glasses, ice and Diet Coke, and the two gave it a try there and then. In case you want to try it at home, they mixed together approximately three parts Coke and one part champagne. Stephen seemed pretty convinced, calling the drink ‘strangely, strikingly, shamefully good’. Suffice it to say, our curiosity was piqued. We honestly struggle to fathom a stranger alcoholic combination, so we decided to put it to the test. Read on for not one, but two reviews from Metro.co.uk staff.
