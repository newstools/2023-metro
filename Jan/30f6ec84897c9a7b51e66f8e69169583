Police will visit 1,000 homes this week in a bid to crack down on football fans watching matches on illegal streams. Anti-piracy investigators from Federation Copyright Theft (FACT) in ‘Operation Raider’ will try and track individuals who have been watching games in England and across Europe illegally via modified boxes or fire sticks. They are taking matters into their own hands and will knock on doors to warn people about the potential consequences. The streams have also been used to watch other sports and movies, which the police are clamping down on. They believe illegal streaming sites can be linked with organised crime gangs, with advertising on the web generating funds. ‘Operation Raider’ will move into action, working with FACT in the next few days, report the Mirror. Detective Chief Inspector Gary Robinson, of the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, said: ‘Accessing films, TV series and live sports events from unauthorised sources is illegal, can expose consumers to risks such as data theft and malware, and can help fund organised criminal groups.’ Two years ago, two men, Paul Faulkner and Stephen Millington, were given 16-month prison sentences for watching illegal streams. And the renewed police interest in clamping down on illegal streaming will be welcome news to major broadcasters, BT Sport and Sky Sports, who televise the majority of the football shown in the UK.
