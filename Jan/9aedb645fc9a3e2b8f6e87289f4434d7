Could there be life on Mars? Well, this might qualify as the bear minimum. NASA scientists have identified a peculiar formation on the Red Planet’s surface that looks remarkably similar to the face of a grizzly bear. The strange image was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from a height of 251 km. The spacecraft took the photo with its HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera, which is the most powerful ever to be deployed to another planet. NASA explained the true nature of the curious formation: ‘This feature looks a bit like a bear’s face. What is it really? ‘There’s a hill with a V-shaped collapse structure (the nose), two craters (the eyes), and a circular fracture pattern (the head). ‘The circular fracture pattern might be due to the settling of a deposit over a buried impact crater. ‘Maybe the nose is a volcanic or mud vent and the deposit could be lava or mud flows? ‘Maybe just grin and bear it,’ they said.
