Manchester United will consider a late move for a midfielder in the transfer window if scan results confirm Christian Eriksen is set for a spell on the sidelines. The Dane was the victim of nasty challenge from Reading’s Andy Carroll on Saturday night, which forced Eriksen off the field. The midfielder played a long-range pass moments after the challenge but lasted less than a minute longer on the pitch and was substituted by Erik ten Hag. The challenge – which received only a yellow card – left Eriksen in discomfort and the swelling over the next hour forced the former Inter Milan ace to leave the ground on crutches and in a protective boot. Eriksen was sent for a scan on the issue yesterday and United are fearful that he could be set for a spell on the sidelines. The news comes at a time when United face 19 matches in the next 57 days, with an average of a game every three days. With Donny van de Beek out for the season, United are light in midfield and Ten Hag will consider a move for a new midfielder in the next 48 hours if Eriksen’s injury is severe. Given there’s so little time left in the window, United would likely be forced into seeking for loan deals. Wout Weghorst has been the club’s only arrival this month and he arrived as a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, who had his contract terminated in December.
