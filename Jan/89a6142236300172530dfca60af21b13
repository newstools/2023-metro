A sex fiend left councillors ‘shocked and appalled’ after hacking into their Zoom meeting and ‘pleasuring himself’ live on camera. Flintshire Council in North Wales was holding a cabinet meeting to discuss waste strategies in the area when an unknown man suddenly joined the call. Councillor Bernie Attridge said: ‘A councillor was saying they were concerned their account had been hacked as messages began appearing in the chat function. ‘Someone had joined the link which is strictly only available to elected members, not the public. This chap who was on the link kept changing his name in the chat. ‘I sent a message asking a question and the next thing I knew there was a chap pleasuring himself full screen on my iPad for a few seconds before the screen went completely black. ‘I’ve had messages from fellow councillors who were watching to say they were shocked and appalled.’ Red-faced councillors continued the meeting on a different platform but Mr Attridge believes the security breach proves they should be chatting in person. He said: ‘If the cabinet, which is just eight councillors, were back in the Clwyd Room at County Hall or even the chamber this wouldn’t happen. ‘I do not understand why they are still meeting on Zoom only. Cabinet is one of the most important meetings in the council.’ Flintshire Council added: ‘A member of the public was given access to the link for this morning’s Cabinet meeting on Zoom and shared some extremely inappropriate content. ‘We expect that only officers and councillors can join meetings as a participant. As a result of this incident, we shall be reviewing the security settings in meetings so that only designated officers can share content. ‘We shall also be reminding all councillors that the links are for them only and that the public can view meetings via the livestream on our website.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
