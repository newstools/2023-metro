Tonightâ€™s Love Island kicked off with a raunchy game to break the ice between the islanders â€“Â but Lana Jenkinsâ€™ sensual dance didnâ€™t go quite to plan. During the game, the make-up artist was tasked with choosing the contestant that she fancied the most to pick from the circle around the firepit and give a lap dance, shortly after bombshell Tom Clareâ€™s arrival. Rather than go for financial advisor Ron Hall, who she coupled up with on the first day, she instead chose airport security advisor Shaq Muhammad in a shock decision. As she stood in front of Shaq, who had sat down on the bench, Lana dropped down in front of himâ€¦ but immediately sprung up when she realised sheâ€™d ripped a whole in the back of her skirt. Speaking in the Beach Hut about the unfortunate incident, she explained: â€˜My skirt split right open, right down the middle of my crack.â€™ Fortunately, Lana didnâ€™t seem too embarrassed by the tear, brushing off the blunder like a pro. However, over on Twitter, fans couldnâ€™t help but feel second-hand embarrassment for her. â€˜Not Lana splitting her skirt,â€™ one person wrote, while another said: â€˜Loool poor Lana ðŸ’€how unfortunate.â€™ â€˜No she did not. Lana omg,â€™ another exclaimed, as one very shocked fan remarked: â€˜Not Lanaâ€™s skirt ripping when she slut dropped eye-.â€™ Several viewers were staggered by the fact that Lana expressed interest in Shaq, having previousy appeared to have had tunnel vision when it came to Ron. â€˜Whyâ€™s no one asking Lana about choosing Shaq,â€™ a confused Twitter user wrote, as another stated: â€˜Did we miss a chapter of Lana fancying Shaq?â€™ While Shaq still seems set on pursuing biomedical student Tanya Manhenga, who heâ€™s coupled up with, time will tell if his head will turn. Love Island returns tomorrow at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. Got a story?
