Stacey Solomon and her little girl Rose were the ultimate mother/daughter duo in matching outfits over the weekend. The Loose Women presenter, 33, who is currently pregnant with her fifth child, made the most of her time with her youngest child, and the pair both dressed in adorable striped t-shirts. While Rose sported a white tutu, Stacey opted for a white midi-skirt, which proudly showed her growing bump. Captioning her post, Stacey penned: ‘A day out with my little lady…🤍 Couldn’t not post these 🥹 Got to have a girls day yesterday with Rosey Posey and I only wish I had my own adult sized tutu so we could be even more matchy 😂 ‘I know one day our matching days will be a distant memory so I made the most yesterday… 🖤 To the moon & back Rose 🌹 Happy Sunday Everyone. Lots of love from me and my girl.’ (sic) Stacey’s followers adored the mother and daughter fits and flooded her post with loving messages. Cleaning influencer Mrs Hinch was among the celebrities to post a comment, and wrote: ‘Absolute Mumma and daughter goals ❤️🥹 I promise you now if I could pull off the boys football kits I would dress the same as them 😂😂 xx have the best Sunday darling.’ Meanwhile, comedian Katherine Ryan added: ‘Beautiful girls 😍’ Stacey announced last month that she and husband Joe Swash, 40, are expecting another child together. Their new bundle of joy will be their third child together after welcoming son Rex in May 2019, and daughter Rose on Stacey’s 32nd birthday in October 2021. However, they boast a blended family as Joe was already father to son Harry, 14, from his previous relationship with ex-fiancée Emma Sophocleous, while Stacey has sons Zach, 14, and Leighton, 10, with former partners Dean Cox and Aaron Barnham respectively. Their pregnancy announcement came just months after Stacey and Joe married in a lavish and intimate summer ceremony at their Essex home, named Pickle Cottage, in July. Got a story?
