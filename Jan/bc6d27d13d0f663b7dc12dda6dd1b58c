An emotional Paul Burrell has revealed that he has prostate cancer. The 64-year-old former royal aide made the tearful announcement on Lorraine, sharing that he found out last year. Paul admitted that he didn’t think such a thing would ever happen to him, and he’s now on an ’emotional, educational rollercoaster.’ Giving the daytime presenter an update, he said: ‘I’m tired, I’m on hormone therapy, it’s robbing me of my testosterone so my beard isn’t growing as it should, I’m tired, and I’m getting hot flushes. ‘In the summer I had to go for a medical for a TV programme I was doing and their duty of care was to go for a full medical. ‘And out of that was a high level of a chemical PSA produced by your prostate gland.’ Struggling to hold it together, Paul, whose children live in America, added: ‘I was wrapping Christmas presents, wondering, “Will I be here next Christmas?” ‘I had to tell my boys, and they said to me, “Dad, we need to spend more time with you”, and that’s what it’s about.’ The close confidante to Princess Diana then urged viewers to get checked and go for ‘a simple blood test,’ to detect possible signs of prostate cancer early on. He said that he was ‘lucky’ to have caught his when he did, as ‘there are thousands of men out there who don’t have symptoms.’ ‘You’ve got loads of lovely female viewers who can say to their men, “Go get tested”,’ he told the Scottish host. Paul was catapulted into public life when he served as a footman to the late Queen Elizabeth II, and a butler to Diana, Princess of Wales. At just 18, he worked as the Queen’s personal footman for a year, with the late Princess once describing him as her ‘rock’ after they grew close.
