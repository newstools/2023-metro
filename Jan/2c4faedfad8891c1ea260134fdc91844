The Duke of Sussex has said he is ‘genuinely happy for the Queen’ following her ‘amazing life’. Prince Harry has appeared on The Late Show in America to promote his new memoir Spare. The book includes claims that the Prince of Wales physically attacked him and reveals texts between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton. Harry was asked by host Stephen Colbert what he remembers most about his late grandmother the Queen. Harry replied: ‘Her sharp wit, her sense of humour, her ability to respond to anybody with a completely straight face. But totally joking. ‘She was incredibly humorous. ‘I’m genuinely happy for her because she finished life. She had an amazing life, she had an amazing career and she was buried with her husband. ‘And bearing in mind the global suffering that everybody’s experienced over the last three years, there was less suffering for both of my grandparents. ‘I’m really, really grateful for that.’ Harry also denied ‘boasting’ about killing 25 Taliban in Afghanistan during the interview. He claimed ‘dangerous’ lies had been told and that his family and the press had made efforts to undermine Spare. The Duke of Sussex was then asked by The Late Show host Stephen Colbert to talk about his trip to the North Pole where his penis was frost-nipped. Harry asked the CBS host ‘can I have a drink?’ before adding: ‘How long have you been waiting to ask that question?’. The duke then said: ‘We’ve taken quite a leap from grief and trauma to my todger.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
