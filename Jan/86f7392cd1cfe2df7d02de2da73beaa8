A young driver has lost his licence in dramatic style – just 24 hours after passing his test. The motorist has been branded an ‘idiot’ after news of his arrest, for suspected drug-driving, emerged. Police even joked that a new ‘record’ had now been set. The dopey driver was stopped in Hastings, East Sussex, on January 5. He failed a roadside test used to find traces of cocaine and cannabis. Sussex Roads Police tweeted: ‘We’ve arrested a man in Hastings on suspicion of drug-driving. ‘Who, it turns out, only passed his driving test yesterday. ‘This could be a record.’ One Twitter user, with the account name DJlikesCyprus, wrote: ‘Given the time the drugs tested for apparently remain in the system, I wonder if he was over the limit when he took his test?’ Sussex Roads Police responded: ‘Quite possibly. We’ll never know.’ Robert Tapping responded to the tweet: ‘One day driving, three years off hopefully.’ Andrew Scudds added: ‘Probably best he stays off the roads with that attitude.’ It may not be the UK, but the Hastings driver didn’t quite match one ‘record’ set in Germany. In 2018, a teenager managed to lose his licence just 49 minutes after getting it. The 18-year-old was closed driving 95km/h (60mph) in a 50km/h (30mph) zone as he returned from the test centre. ‘Some things last for ever – others not for an hour,’ German police had written in their statement.
