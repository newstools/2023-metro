A dad-of-three who fantasised about snatching a boy off the street has had another two years added to his sentence. Robert Odlin, 45, will have to serve another two years after it was discovered that he tried to make a fellow inmate his sex slave and referred to him as his bitch. Odlin was serving two years at Hull after admitting that he had contacted other paedophiles to get their help in kidnapping a young boy to rape him. Now he’s pleaded guilty to touching and rubbing another prisoner from behind. When his victim refused to carry out a sex act on him, Odlin told him ‘you’re not a good bitch’. He was released briefly but admitted exposing himself following his early release. Judge Sophie McKone told Odlin: ‘You humiliated him. You groomed him. ‘It must have been obvious to you from his demeanour and his vulnerability that he did not want to engage in this sort of sexual behaviour with you. ‘But you couldn’t care less and you couldn’t care less that he was clearly scared of you.’ Defending him, Julia Baggs said he brought the matter to the attention of authorities. She said: ‘He made it clear that he wanted to confess and that he knew he needed some help. ‘He knows that he needs assistance to move on from this type of behaviour. He has similar troubling offending on his record. ‘He has been using his time in custody wisely. He wants to change and better himself.’ Describing him as a dangerous offender, Judge McKone jailed him for two years and he will be on licence for two years when he is released. A 10-year sexual harm prevention order has now been extended to his whole life and he will have to register as a sex offender. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
