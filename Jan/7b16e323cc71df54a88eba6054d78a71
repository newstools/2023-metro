An Aston Villa fan has been banned from attending matches for three years for racially abusing Raheem Sterling. Timothy Hyslop, 54, shouted a racist slur when the Chelsea and England star was on the ball during a Premier League game at Villa Park. He made the outburst during Chelsea’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa on October 16 last year. Hyslop was quizzed by police after the game and charged with a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence. He appeared at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday where he pleaded guilty to the charge. PC Stuart Ward, football hate crime officer at West Midlands Police, said: ‘This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated. ‘Abusing anyone for the colour of their skin is disgusting and can never, ever be condoned. ‘There is no place for racism in football or society in general. I would like to thank Aston Villa for their assistance during this investigation.’ Hyslop, of Britannia Drive, Burton, Staffs., was handed a three-year football banning order (FBO). He was also ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £538. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
