It might be absolutely freezing in the UK today but Love Island is soaring back into our lives tonight whether we want it or not. Maya Jama will make her long-awaited debut as host, the role which honestly she was born to fill, and we’ll meet our new islanders with the first coupling up ceremony. The boys are the first to arrive and this time the girls will be picking which gent to couple up with. ‘Well boys, it is time to couple up,’ Maya tells the group – Shaq, Harris, Will, Ron and Kai ‘The girls will come in one by one and I’ll ask you to step forward if you fancy them. ‘Each girl will then decide which boy she wants to couple up with. It’s that simple. So who’s ready to meet our first girl?’ Then it’s time to meet the women, with Tanya, Anna-May, Lana, Olivia and Tanyel all making their way into the villa. ‘We now have five lovely couples but will you stay together or will your heads be turned?’ Maya teases, before making a joke about her own love life. ‘Don’t forget finding your perfect match is never that simple, trust me I know…’ However, of course it’s not that simple as a new bombshell who has been voted to be the first arrival by the public will enter to ruffle some feathers. Are we ready? Nope. Are we already adducted? Absolutely. Love Island returns tonight at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. Got a story?
