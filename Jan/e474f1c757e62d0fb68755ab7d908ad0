Chelsea paid an emotional tribute to their late former player and manager Gianluca Vialli prior to Sunday’s clash against Crystal Palace. Former Chelsea and Italy striker Vialli died aged 58 earlier this month following a battle with pancreatic cancer. Vialli was a club legend at Chelsea – helping the Blues win the FA Cup in 1997 to end their 26-year wait for a major trophy – and also helped them win the League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup. He later became player-manager and manager, again lifting the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup as well as the UEFA Super Cup as he became the second-most successful boss in Chelsea history in terms of trophies won. ‘Before kick-off against Crystal Palace, we will be welcoming players who were either team-mates of Luca or were coached by him at Chelsea onto the pitch,’ Chelsea said in a statement on Sunday morning. ‘There they will join the current Chelsea side and the Palace players in a minute’s applause by way of a tribute. ‘Having warmed up in special t-shirts, the players will wear black armbands during the game. ‘For anyone who wishes to leave a personal message or memories, a book of condolence will be available between 9.30am and 1.30pm in the Museum building behind the Matthew Harding Stand. ‘If you cannot make it to Stamford Bridge, an online version of the book of condolence is open. ‘On Sunday, there will be a special tribute edition of the match programme, honouring Luca’s legacy with a series of features celebrating his life and career, with a focus on his achievements at the Bridge.’ Vialli scored 40 goals in 88 games for Chelsea as a player, while as a manager, he led Chelsea into the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history.
