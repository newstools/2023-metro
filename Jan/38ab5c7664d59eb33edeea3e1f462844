If you love exploring wine regions in France, a new train line is about to take the faff out of travelling there. Set to launch in 2026, a ‘wine train’ will take passengers direct from London to Bordeaux. Currently, anyone making the journey needs to get a flight or two trains – the Eurostar from St Pancras to Paris’ Gare du Nord and a TGV service from Paris’ Montparnasse station to Bordeaux. So, there’s no denying this new train will take the hassle out of getting to the south of France – whether you’re heading to Bordeaux or beyond. It’s worth pointing out that direct train is still very much in the planning stages – but the journey is predicted to take about five hours each way. It’s also expected to pave the way for future wine trains. According to The Drinks Business, it could be followed by other direct routes between London and destinations such as Cologne, Frankfurt, Geneva, Marseille and Toulouse. Also, with lots of people becoming increasingly aware of their carbon footprints and choosing to fly less, these trains could soar in popularity over the next decade. This is the ultimate aim from HSI chief exec Dyan Crowther (behind the UK leg of the Channel Tunnel railway line) who, according to The Sunday Times, is hoping to open a series of new routes from 2026 in a bid to offer lower carbon emission alternatives compared to short haul flights – and boost the train line’s capacity, as a result.
