Newcastle United midfielder Joelinton has been charged with drink-driving and will appear in court at the end of January. The Brazilian, who was signed by Newcastle in a £40 million deal in 2019, was stopped by police at 1.20am on Thursday morning and was arrested. He was then charged for driving whilst above the prescribed limit for alcohol. Joelinton is due to appear in court on January 26 – two days after the first leg of Newcastle’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Southampton. ‘Shortly before 1.20am today [Thursday] officers pulled over a vehicle in the Ponteland Road area of Newcastle and arrested the occupant,’ a police spokesperson said. ‘Joelinton Casio, 26, of Ponteland, has since been charged whilst above the prescribed limit for alcohol. He is due to appear before magistrates in Newcastle on January 26.’ Joelinton scored in Newcastle’s 2-0 win against Leicester City at St James’ Park on Tuesday evening as Eddie Howe’s side reached the Carabao Cup semi-final for the first time in 47 years. The Brazilian was named Newcastle’s player of the year last season. For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
