A man has injured several people in a knife attack at the Gare du Nord train station in Paris. The incident took place at 6.45am when the station was busy with commuters. Six people have been injured. French interior minister Gérald Darmanin confirmed the suspect had been shot by police forces. He told reporters at the scene that the man had attacked several people, including a police officer, with a ‘bladed weapon’ at around 6.43am local time. The unnamed assailant is currently ‘between life and death’ in hospital. Several passengers and a border police officer were among the wounded, according to officials. The officer was stabbed in the back by the assailant, but was saved by a bulletproof vest, Mr Darmanin said. Another of the other victims was seriously injured in the shoulder and taken for emergency treatment. Mr Darmanin thanked the police ‘for their effective and courageous reaction’. Video of the Gare du Nord, one of the French capital’s busiest commuter stations, showed an eerie calm with dozens of police stationed by the Eurostar terminal entrance in areas cordoned off from the public. No specific motive, including terrorism, has currently been suggested by authorities. French train operator SNCF told local media that ‘the emergency services intervened and the person evacuated. A spokesperson added: ‘A security perimeter has been established but the station continues to operate normally’. Media reports, quoting unnamed police sources, say officers opened fire on the attacker, who was armed with a knife and injured several people. Got a story?
