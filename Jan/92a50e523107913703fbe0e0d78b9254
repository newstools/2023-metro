Stomach-churning video has shown the moments visitors to a Chinese amusement park were left stranded upside down. The group became stuck 10 metres in the air after the theme parkâ€™s pendulum ride came to an abrupt stop. They were forced to anxiously wait for mechanics to rush to the scene and fix the problem. The nightmarish experience took place at a theme park in Funan County, Anhui Province on January 19. Witnesses filmed the scare and shared the footage on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. In the videos, 20 people can be seen trapped in their seats with their feet up in the air. Both they and the dozens of viewers on ground seemingly stood helpless while they waited for the pendulum to correct itself and begin moving again. It was reportedly a 10-minute wait before the trapped people could get off. After the footage began circling social media, the Anhui Shinet Entertainment Co. Ltd., the management company, released a statement. Staff claimed that the big pendulum was swinging by inertia because the weight of the people sitting on both sides was the same, so it stopped at the top, and it recovered in about 10 minutes. They added they carry out daily checks on the machine. Staff also said that if any of the involved tourists experienced discomfort, they can get reimbursed with a hospital check-up receipt.
