What do ‘Omg!’, ‘No way!’ and ‘Gah, I knew it!’ have in common? They’re all things one might scream when finding out their favourite celebrity is pregnant. As far as famous babies go, we had some big hitters this year, with the likes of Rihanna, Grimes and Jennifer Lawrence all welcoming mini A-listers into the world. But 2023 is gearing up to be just as stellar on the celebrity baby front, with a whole host of famous faces set to welcome little ones over the coming months. So, in light of that, we present to you: a round-up of all the celebrities set to become first, third, and even fourth-time parents in the new year. The 23-year-old Love Island lovebirds announced in September that they’re expecting their first child together, and we haven’t been the same since. The pair announced the news on social media, sharing a heart-melting montage of their three-year romance alongside the caption: ‘I can’t wait for the adventures that we haven’t even dreamed of yet.’ Molly and Tommy have revealed they’re expecting a little girl and it’s thought she’ll arrive earthside in late January or early February. Shaughna shot to fame on the winter edition of Love Island back in 2020 and has spent the last few years building a loyal fanbase with her candid social media posts. The mum-to-be announced her pregnancy on Instagram in October, writing: ‘Our greatest chapter yet…’ While Shaughna’s partner’s hand could be seen clasping her belly in the clip, she’s remained largely schtum when it comes to his identity, explaining to her fans that he doesn’t want to be in the public eye. The entertainment industry’s golden couple revealed they’ll welcome their fourth child together back in September. The Gossip Girl actress, 35, confirmed the news while at the Forbes Power Women’s Summit in New York, unveiling her growing baby bump on the red carpet. Blake and Ryan, 46, are already parents to three daughters, James, Inez and Betty. Keke broke the news that she was expecting her first child live on SNL earlier this month, sending the internet into overdrive. The Nope star told the audience she was ‘setting some rumours straight,’ explaining: ‘People have been in my comments saying, “Keke’s having a baby, Keke’s pregnant,” and I wanna set the record straight.’ She then ripped open her blazer and revealed her baby bump before delightedly declaring: ‘I am!’ G’wan girl. The Big Bang Theory star announced in October that she was gearing up to welcome her first child. Taking to Instagram, Kaley shared snaps of the pair eating a cake with pink icing and holding a baby grow alongside Polaroid snaps of numerous pregnancy tests and her growing baby bump. Kaley, 36, wrote: ‘Baby girl Pelphrey coming 2023. Beyond blessed and over the moon… I 💓you @tommypelphrey !!!’ The Love Island star, 27, revealed on Christmas Eve that she and Mark were expecting in a sweet Instagram post. The cute video started at the beach with ‘Baby O’Connor’ written in the sand before cutting to Montana holding a positive pregnancy test and beaming with Mark by her side. The starlet captioned the post, which was soundtracked to James Arthur’s track Heartbeat: ‘Baby O’Connor coming next summer.’ Another December baby announcement came courtesy of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore’s daughter Rumer and her partner Derek. Rumer confirmed the news on social media, alongside boyfriend Derek, in a series of sweet snapshots of her growing bump. In one, the 34-year-old singer and actress was seen showing off her bump which Derek wrapped his hand around and gave a kiss to. Cute doesn’t even cut it. Jordan and Naomi shared the happy news that they’re gearing up to welcome their third child together back in October. The couple, who tied the knot in August, shared the exciting news on Instagram, posting a beaming photo of themselves in the car, holding a picture of the baby’s ultrasound scan up to the camera. Chrissy and John’s fans were over the moon when the former revealed in August that she was pregnant again, two years after the death of their son Jack. Alongside photos of her baby bump, the TV presenter wrote in an Instagram post: ‘The last few years have been a blur of emotions to say the least, but joy has filled our home and hearts again. 1 billion shots later (in the leg lately, as u can see!) we have another on the way. ‘Every appointment I’ve said to myself, “ok if it’s healthy today I’ll announce” but then I breathe a sigh of relief to hear a heartbeat and decide I’m just too nervous still.’ She added: ‘I don’t think I’ll ever walk out of an appointment with more excitement than nerves but so far, everything is perfect and beautiful and I’m feeling hopeful and amazing. Ok phew it’s been very hard keeping this in for so long!’ Chrissy and John share daughter Luna, six, and son Miles, four. Daisy and Jordan announced on social media in October that they were expecting their first child together after getting engaged a month prior. Daisy, 33, shared the exciting news with a photo of her growing bump, alongside a snap of her ultrasound scan, stating that she and Jordan are ‘bursting’ with happiness. The model, who has been with her fiance for roughly two years, wrote: ‘I wanted to share some news with you- Jordan & I are having a baby. We are absolutely bursting at the seams with happiness. ‘I’m oscillating wildly between excitement & nervousness with a dash of morning sickness thrown in for good measure! Big love to all of you.’ They’ve certainly come a long way since first meeting on Strictly Come Dancing back in 2018. Stacey and Kevin confirmed in August that they were expecting their first child, telling fans in a social media post: ‘Gaaaaaaang….. We are having a baby! 🤪 So bl**dy delighted. Kev, you’re magic, I love youuuu.’ Last, but most certainly not least, we have Stacey and Joe’s recent announcement that they’re expecting their third child together. The Loose Women presenter, 33, announced the news via Instagram on Wednesday with a video of her presenting former EastEnders actor Joe with her positive pregnancy test. She revealed in the caption: ‘Me + Him = 👦🏻👦🏼👦🏼🧒🏼👧🏼👶 So grateful & can not believe I’m saying this… Another little pickle is on the way… 😭 A HUGE surprise, but one that we are so thankful for 🥹 to the moon & back bub.’ And, another major plot twist from Stace – she’s due in about a month!
