Police have arrested a man on suspicion of kidnap after a pensioner vanished in Essex. Timothy Hatcher, 69, went missing nearly three weeks ago, on December 18. He was last seen at a Co-op on Meadgate Avenue in the village of Great Baddow. Mr Hatcher, who has dementia and receives support from carers, was reported missing two days later. A 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of kidnap, Essex Police added. He has since been released on bail. Detective Superintendent Scott Egerton, who is overseeing the investigation, said that police are ‘incredibly concerned’ for Mr Hatcher’s welfare. ‘Quite clearly, we remain incredibly concerned for Timothy’s welfare; he has not been seen for almost three weeks,’ he said. ‘We have a team of officers working round the clock in order to piece together Timothy’s known movements, including aspects of his financial life and his phone use. ‘Unfortunately, at this stage he remains missing and we continue to focus a great deal of effort in trying to locate him.’ Anyone with any information, CCTV, dash cam or other footage in relation to this incident, have been asked to contact Essex Police, quoting incident 754 of December 20.
