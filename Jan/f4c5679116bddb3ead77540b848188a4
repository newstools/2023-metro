Katherine Ryan is dipping into the conversation around Pete Davidson and his ability to land some of the biggest A-listers. The former Saturday Night Live comedian has been linked to a bevy of absolute headline-stealers including Kim Kardashian, Emily Ratajkowski and Phoebe Dynevor over the years, which led to many wondering how on earth he manages it. Because apparently being nice isn’t enough to land an A-lister, the speculation around the star’s BDE – or, ‘Big D**k Energy’ as they call it – has been front and centre, so to speak. This speculation wasn’t helped when ex-fiancee Ariana Grande alluded to him being blessed in that department when a fan asked how ‘long’ Pete was in regards to her song named after him. Ariana replied at the time: ‘Like 10 inches… oh f**k … I mean … like a lil over a minute.’ From there, Pete was forever cemented in the BDE hall of fame. Wading into the speculation around what Pete may be packing, Katherine said she could ‘confirm’ that he is, indeed, ‘huge’, should you be wondering. She said, during the Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware podcast: ‘I’ve thought about this. So there is an episode of Sex And The City…where Charlotte dates Mr P**sy and Samantha says “you don’t date Mr P**sy you enjoy him then you pass him on”…I think Pete Davidson is the modern-day Mr P**sy… ‘I have information about this, so the d**k is huge. But do you know a lot of comedians are very well-endowed. I haven’t slept with many of them, but we talk about them and lots of my friends have slept with lots of them.’ Speaking with singer Jessie and her mother Lennie more about this, Katherine went on: ‘This is the thing, I don’t think women care about baldness as much as men care about baldness…It’s this language with men where they mind amongst each other. ‘Similarly, they grow up seeing each other’s willies in dressing rooms or whatever, I don’t care if someone has a big willy, truth be told I think it would bother me if someone had a very, very small penis, equally a very, very big penis. ‘I want to ride a horse sometimes and I don’t want to be injured, but I think it is again a language between men where they give each other a certain level of respect based on that, starts very young. I think based on the respect you’re given the deference…’ She went on in regards to Pete: ‘I haven’t seen it, but I’ve had it confirmed.’ Jessie joked: ‘I would tap that Mr P**sy up.’ Katherine added that’s not the only allure to the man, adding: ‘He’s charming and he’s sweet and I think he’s funny and his story, if you have any bone in your body that’s tied to a rescue syndrome… ‘He was young on Saturday Night Live, really nice sort of hip hop energy, in a very attractive, young man.’ She said: ‘He’s weird, men don’t have to be gorgeous…you [Jessie] think he’s gorgeous, that’s key. [He’s gorgeous] because of all the other factors…if you took him as a skin suit and put Benedict Cumberbatch inside him, he wouldn’t be attractive.’ Listen to the full episode of Table Manners, out now.
