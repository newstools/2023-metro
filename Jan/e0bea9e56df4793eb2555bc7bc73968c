However, ‘cloud skin’ is here to change that. It’s a new trend that does away with shine and is instead about looking subtly lit from within, with a powdered veil over the top. Think of it like putting a thick piece cloth over a light source – it dulls the light down, but it’s not completely gone. This is why the look is so flattering and not the matte skin you might remember from you teenage years (no Dream Matte Mousse overload here). The key is to make sure you start with highly moisturising products underneath. Makeup artist Dominic Skinner uses the new MAC skincare range for the look, and you can use any rich cream. We tested it and can vouch for it working well under makeup. That’s your ‘lit from within’ part – then you’ll need matte products. Taking a matte foundation, or mixing a matte primer into your usual foundation as Dominic does, apply a light layer over the face. You don’t want it to look heavy and mask-like, so build up slowly. After that, stick to powder, mousse or dry cream formulas to finish the skin. In other words, put the highlighter down. A setting powder is a good idea if your foundation is looking a little too shiny on the T-zone. On TikTok, plenty have been trying the trend and putting their own spin on it. Glowy skin isn’t out, but matte skin is getting a second lease of life. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
