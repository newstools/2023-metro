Supporters of Brazilian far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro have stormed Congress and police have used tear gas in an attempt to repel them. The dramatic scenes came a week after left-wing veteran Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s inauguration. Supporters climbed on top of the building’s roof and broke the glass in its windows. Other demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace and supreme court, though it was not immediately clear if they managed to break into the buildings. The incidents, similar to the invasion of the US Capitol last year come after leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sworn in on January 1. Supporters of Mr Bolsonaro – who refuse to accept that he lost the election – broke through barriers and entered the building in the capital, Brasília. Protesters – who smashed windows of the building – had been camping nearby. Mr da Silva – better known as Lula – defeated Jair Bolsonaro in October’s election. In his inauguration speech, Lula vowed to rebuild a country in ‘terrible ruins’. He decried the policies of his predecessor, who went to the US to avoid the handover ceremony.
