There’s a new caffeinated offering at M&S for 2023 and it’s shaking up the UK’s coffee scene. The supermarket’s new ‘Magic Coffee’ is now available in M&S cafes and from ‘to-go’ machines in foodhalls. So what’s so different about this new drink? The new beverage, originally from Australia, claims to have the ‘magic’ perfectly-balanced ratio of coffee to milk. Brought about to give the flat white a run for its money, it’s very similar but made with a double ristretto (rather than a double espresso) and served with steamed milk – with the aim of being less bitter. Experts say a ristretto uses the same amount of ground coffee as an espresso but is extracted using half the water, and in a shorter time. Using less water creates a more concentrated taste, and the shorter extraction time brings a different flavour balance to the coffee. So the ristretto extraction stops before the bitterness stage. The addition of milk at the end then helps with the sweetness a little bit more. The result? A coffee that’s full of flavour – but without the bitter taste. So, is it worth diverting from your usual coffee order? Sharon Lougher, the head of features at Metro, gave it a whirl and shared her thoughts. Do you have a story to share?
