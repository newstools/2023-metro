You could soon splash out on a Pornstar Martini or Sex on the Beach cocktail in London’s newest Wetherspoons – housed in a former strip club. Applications have been submitted to make changes to two buildings on Eversholt Street, opposite Euston train station, in the north of the city. The building, built the early 19th century, formerly hosted a SophistiCats strip club. It once described itself as a ‘premier gentleman’s club’ which ‘works with the most beautiful performers from all over the world’. SophistiCats promised ‘discretion, anonymity’ and ‘a stylish evening of table dancing in a luxurious environment’. Wetherspoons’ designers nineteen47 now want to change both the ground and basement floors in the buildings to transform it into a watering hole. They also intend to re-create the shopfront with a new entranceway and large windows, according to the plans. If given the green light, this Wetherspoons branch will have outdoor seating so punters can enjoy a beer in the sunshine – when it eventually comes. The Campaign for Real Ale, an organisation which believes in protecting pubs as social centres, has backed the idea. It said ‘the pub will act as a valuable resource for the local community’ which is ‘not something that the nightclub really did’. SophistiCats was one of the Camden borough’s last adult entertainment venues, as the council has essentially stopped issuing licences for these kinds of places. The club closed for renovations and had its permit threatened after police investigated claims of suspicion over clients being charged thousands in one night. Bosses and performers argued it was not unusual for people to spend around £50,000 in the industry. But the police commissioner at the time said evidence seen by officers suggests that ‘vulnerable individuals were pressured into spending large amounts of money’ at the premises.
