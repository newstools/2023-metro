An English cocker spaniel from Leeds probably has better hair than you. Lola the four-year-old dog is known for her luscious locks and is even compared to Stacey Solomon and Jennifer Aniston for her impressive hair. But now her owner, Rebecca Dobson, has welcomed another new addition to the family who has an equally impressive mane: Lola’s brunette daughter Nellie. Rebecca, 23, says that the family did wonder if Lola’s pups would inherit her great hair gene – especially as many people often think the mother dog is wearing a wig. The owner said: ‘All of her puppies had beautiful little mutton chops, just like she did when she was little. ‘They were all beautiful, but Nellie was just so sweet and so like her mum that I couldn’t bear to give her away, so we had to keep her.’ The mother and daughter duo are very alike in many ways and love nothing more than a good pamper session. Rebecca said: ‘Both Lola and Nellie are so similar – they love being pampered and getting attention, and hate getting muddy. ‘When I’m walking the dogs altogether most of them love a splash in the sea or in the mud. But Lola and Nellie will sit on the sidelines making sure they keep out of the way.’ And, fortunately for Rebecca, their hair doesn’t require a lot of extra maintenance, as long as it’s brushed carefully at least once a day. ‘Both of them love being pampered though so it’s never a problem,’ added Rebecca.
