Four people have been arrested after a car drove mounted a kerb and knocked down two people. They were hit at around 1.30am yesterday morning in Wembley, north-west London, following a fight in the High Road. A witness who said they were awoken by ’noise of yelling’ in the early hours said: ‘I woke up at just gone 1am to hear yelling outside. ‘From my balcony I could see a group of eight to 10 people outside the post office, who were yelling and occasionally pushing each other, but not full on fighting so it seemed like something that would blow over. ‘However, after 10 minutes or so of this continuing, a car mounted the pavement about where the Subway shop is, and drove towards the post office, at the people on that pavement.’ They told MyLondon that they believed the car knocked two people down. Police said they were met by a ‘large and challenging crowd of people’ at the scene in the early hours. Two people, a man and woman in their 50s, were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Four people remain in police custody, with enquiries ongoing to establish the circumstances. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
