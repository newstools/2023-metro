The fiancée of a TV journalist who was killed in a series of shootings in Florida is seeking to have his baby through IVF after harvesting his sperm. Casey Fite called Dylan Lyons, 24, the ‘love of my life’ and said they were planning to start a family before he was gunned down during a live crime scene broadcast on February 22. Police arrested Keith Melvin Moses, 22, in connection with the fatal shootings of Spectrum News 13 reporter Lyons, T’Yonna Major, 9, and Nathacha Augustin, 38. In a GoFundMe page launched on Thursday, Fite wrote that Dylan and she ‘wanted nothing more than to get married and have children’. ‘The night he passed away, I researched about harvesting his sperm,’ Fite wrote. ‘I called doctor after doctor until I found one who was able to perform the procedure within the 24 hour period. ‘The doctor was able to retrieve 8 vials of his sperm, and I am going to do IVF to have the baby we so desperately wanted to have together.’ Fite said that Lyons would have been the best father and that she is ‘devastated he can’t be here for what we always wanted’. She set a $50,000 goal for the fundraiser to help her pay for IVF. ‘Any contribution would be appreciated so we can still have our baby as I want to keep my Dylan’s legacy alive,’ she concluded. Lyons was in the Pine Hills neighborhood of the Orlando area reporting on the fatal shooting of a woman, who was later identified as Augustin. Moses allegedly returned to the crime scene and shot at a news crew that included Lyons and photojournalist Jesse Walden, who survived.
