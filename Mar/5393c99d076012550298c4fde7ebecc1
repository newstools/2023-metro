Police in Catalonia are investigating the alleged sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman described as English in the local press. The incident reportedly happened at around 4am on Saturday, at a nightclub named Input which is located inside the Spanish city’s Poble Espanyol open-air museum. Reports say the woman was found on a street in Barcelona in a state of shock with a wound to her head, cuts and bruises to her knees and her underwear pulled down. She told the security guards at the club that she had been hit over the head by a stone. Local news website Crónica Global described the woman as ‘Anglo-Saxon’, while TV station Betevé said she was an ‘English national’. The Mossos d’Esquadra, Catalonia’s autonomous police force, was called to the scene at around 5am, and the woman was taken to Hospital Clínic de Barcelona for treatment. No arrests have yet been made as the investigation continues. Officers have not confirmed the nationality of the woman involved. Investigators are understood to be looking for two men who were partially picked up on CCTV. It is believed that they have been able to obtain DNA samples from the woman’s underwear. Despite the lack of arrests, the employers’ association for Catalonia’s nightlife – known as Fecasarm – said they would push for the harshest sentence possible in the case. Joaquim Boadas, the group’s general secretary, told Betevé: ‘We will ask for the highest sentence in the Penal Code so that all those people know that the only way out is prison.’ He said he was concerned that incident could ‘unfairly tarnish the image of the nightlife sector’ in the city.
