Pedro Pascal’s rather intense coffee order has people climbing the walls just looking at it. The Last of Us star was recently photographed leaving a Starbucks and eagle-eyed fans have zoomed in on his cup to get a better look at his order of choice. As it turns out, the 47-year-old is a raging caffeine fanatic. According to Just Jared, Pedro’s order goes as follows: ‘Iced quad espresso in a venti cup with extra ice and six shots.’ The outlet estimates that there are 384milligrams of caffeine in Pedro’s drink, which, according to health expert Livi, is actually 15milligrams short of the recommended max caffeine intake per day. ‘Doctors recommend having no more than 400mg of caffeine a day,’ notes Livi’s website. Still, people were floored by the A-lister’s order and many social media users were quick to comment on the clip, which was first shared on TikTok. One person wrote: ‘That’s insane, is he OK?’ while another echoed: ‘Is his heart OK?’ Other bemused comments included: ‘That is a violent amount of coffee,’ ‘dude must have an iron gut’ and ‘if I survive drinking this do I become Pedro Pascal?’ In other Pedro news, the star recently continued to show support for the LGBT+ community with a powerful post. In an Instagram post shared last week, the star of The Mandalorian uploaded a series of pictures of the Progress Pride flag and the transgender flag. In his caption, the actor wrote: ‘The answer my friend is blowin’ in the wind #LGBTQIA,’ quoting Bob Dylan’s 1962 song Blowin’ in the Wind. Several celebrities commented underneath the post expressing their support for the actor’s sentiments, including his The Last of Us co-star Bella Ramsey, who wrote: ‘Love love love,’ and also shared emoji for the Pride and transgender flags. Actors Sophie Turner and Rachel Zegler both commented on the post with rows of heart emoji, while Pedro’s Wonder Woman 1984 co-star Gal Gadot added: ‘🙌❤️🙌.’ Got a story?
