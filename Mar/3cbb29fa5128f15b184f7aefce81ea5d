Love Island’s Shaughna Phillips has shared an update after going into early labour four days ago. The 28-year-old reality star, who is expecting her first child with ex-boyfriend Billy Webb, was taken into hospital on Monday and has since returned home. And while she has yet to reveal whether her little one has officially arrived, Shaughna has given her fans a glimpse into her current situation. Taking to her Instagram Stories, she shared a screenshot of an online groceries order, which included four croissants, a cucumber, six raspberry and strawberry yoghurts, a variety of different crips, and guacamole. ‘I don’t know what to tell you…’ she captioned the post. Looks like a pretty good basket of goods, pregnancy cravings or not, if you ask us. Shaughna previously revealed that she had headed into hospital on the social media platform. Alongside a reel documenting her admission, she wrote: ‘Soooo what started as a “come to work with me” reel, turned into a “come to the hospital with me”. ‘I had my last job before baby this morning, an international women’s day panel, and just before my cab arrived, things took a turn and I was on the way to the hospital, and have been told I’m in early labour. @annalingis went from make up artist to midwife REAL QUICK! ‘Home now, baby still tucked up nicely, and waiting for nature to do it’s thang [sic]’. Earlier this month, Shaughna hinted at her baby’s due date following the arrest of her unborn child’s father Webb for possession with intent to supply a Class A drug. ‘Hello March, please be a good one. The month my little lamb should arrive,’ she wrote. Got a story?
