An ‘exuberant’ portrait by Pablo Picasso of his daughter has sold for £18.1million at auction. Titled Fillette Au Bateau, Maya, the piece is a ‘joyful’ rendition of Maya Widmaier-Picasso when she was two years old, painted by the Spanish artist in 1938. ‘Filled with exuberant colour and energy, the piece was created shortly after Picasso had completed his monumental Guernica, and encapsulates the happiness Maya brought into his life during these challenging years,’ said auction house Sotheby’s. The piece, previously owned by fashion designer Gianni Versace, well surpassed its £12million estimation. Maya, who died last year aged 87, was Picasso’s child with his mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter – a model the artist started seeing when she was just 17, known as his ‘golden muse’. Sotheby’s art sales on Wednesday achieved £172.6million – with works by Lucian Freud, Edvard Munch and Wassily Kandinsky also sold.
