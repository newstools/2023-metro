In a super wholesome moment, Lizzo paused her Glasgow show to help a fan propose to his boyfriend. The Truth Hurts hitmaker – real name Melissa Viviane Jefferson – sold out the city’s OVO Hydro arena on Wednesday night, and was more than happy to halt her show to help a fan in the audience propose to his boyfriend. The Grammy winner, 34, spotted a gig-goer holding their phone up with the following message on the screen: ‘Ask my brother’s boyfriend to marry him.’ Lizzo then put the microphone in front of the man and he said: ‘Will you marry me?’ Amid cheers from the crowd, he added: ‘For the love of god, just say yes.’ ‘What do you say?’ Lizzo enthused. Superfan Ryan nodded as the crowd roared. ‘Let me get a f*****g yeah,’ the Juice musician shouted, joking that ‘the man was too stunned to speak.’ We hope Lizzo will be able to make the wedding! As for Lizzo’s love life, the singer confirmed she was officially off the market in April last year, but little was known about her and Myke’s relationship at the time. Now, in what the star called a ‘hard launch’, Lizzo has shared a load of cute snaps of the pair together last month. Taking to social media, the self-love Queen joked, ‘Hard Launch😮‍💨’, alongside photos of her and Myke on the red carpet at Clive Davis‘ iconic Pre-Grammy Party in Beverly Hills this weekend. All Lizzo’s celeb pals were loving it too, as Queer Eye’s Jonathan Van Ness commented: ‘I love Lizzo so feckin much my queer bones about to break ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥😍😍😍.’ American musician SZA said, ‘A doll and her Ken 😍😍’, while model Lori Harvey responded: ‘We love a hard launch 😍.’ Got a story?
