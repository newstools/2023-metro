Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has rated Manchester United’s chances of winning the 2022-23 Premier League title ahead of Sunday’s showdown. Klopp’s side host the Red Devils at Anfield as they attempt to continue their push for a top-four finish following a slow start to the season. Sixth-placed Liverpool are 10 points and three positions lower than United in the table as Erik ten Hag’s team look to keep up with Arsenal and Manchester City. United have been in fantastic form since the resumption of the domestic season after the World Cup in Qatar and Klopp has now assessed their title credentials. The German manager, who led Liverpool to the 2019-20 Premier League title, said on Friday: ‘They turned into a result machine. Top football, if it’s not going well, they still get results. ‘They’re in a fight for the league, but again, not really important for Sunday, we are there as well. We try to be at our best.’ Klopp added: ‘I didn’t think too much about [their win in the Carabao Cup final]. Surprised? Probably not. ‘How could they not be successful? They’re really experienced, they have quality and a good way of playing. ‘[They have found] a new way to defend. The difference in the last few years, a massive difference, man orientated. ‘With the ball, quality, it’s not like, ‘I did that’, Erik knows [Marcus] Rashford is a real talent. It’s a really good team, how could they not be successful. ‘It’s difficult, pretty much impossible to be happy about something at Man United as the Liverpool manager. ‘One result is I am happy for Rashford, he had a difficult last year, he was not performing as he is able to perform. ‘This will change again, he’s playing incredible, the speed, technique, the calmness in front of goal.’ MORE : Paul Merson makes Liverpool v Man Utd prediction ahead of Anfield clash MORE : Jurgen Klopp sends warning to Man Utd after Liverpool’s win over Wolves
