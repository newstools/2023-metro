Images of a young woman’s tattoos have been shared by detectives, three months after her body washed ashore. Officers from Sussex Police have tried in vain to identify the woman and trace her friends and family. Her body was found on Tuesday, December 20 at the water’s edge at Saltdean, Brighton. A member of the public walking in the area had raised the alarm with the police around 1.20pm. In the weeks that followed, officers were unable to identify the woman. Police have now released photos of a number of tattoos that she had on her arms and legs in the hopes someone will recognise them. In a statement, Sussex Police said: ‘Extensive enquiries have been made to try to identify her, but so far these have been unsuccessful. ‘The woman is white, believed to be aged between 20 and 25, around 5’ 4″ and of slim to medium build. She was wearing a purple sports bra, dark mauve sports leggings and Converse black boots with the original white trim. ‘It is not thought that she had been in the water for much more than 24 hours and enquiries with maritime authorities suggest that it is possible that she entered the water further west, with tidal action taking her to Saltdean.’ Anyone who recognises the tattoos or has any information about the woman is asked to report to Sussex Police online or by calling 101 quoting serial 598 of 20/12.
