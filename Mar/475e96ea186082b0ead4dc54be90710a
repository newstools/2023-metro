Kate Middleton stepped out wearing a black and white headscarf today while meeting volunteers. The Prince and Princess of Wales visited Hayes Muslim Centre in Hillingdon, London, to thank fundraisers who’ve been helping communities affected by the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, which have left thousands homeless. The royals chatted to representatives who, through bucket collections and other donations after prayers, have raised more than £25,000 for the appeal. Kate teamed the headscarf, from Élan, with a modest dark grey coat and a black pleated Alexander McQueen dress with tights, coupled with her black Grace Han bag. The visit comes a day after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their daughter Lilibet has been christened – and will use the title of ‘Princess’ going forwards. Sources claimed that the Sussexes invited King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Kate to the event, though none were said to be in attendance. In recent months, Kate has shown a love for teaming high-end items with bargain buys from the high street. The internet went wild when she style an Alexander McQueen gown with £18 Zara earrings at the Baftas in February, and she was also recently snapped in a £20 Zara houndstooth skirt, paired with a Mulberry bag. On laid back days, her neutral Veja trainers have become go-tos. Her coats have also had us swooning in recent weeks, from her staple camel Massimo Dutti number to a bold red look from Alexander McQueen. Today’s scarf was worn for the more subdued occasion, but was previously worn as part of a set by Kate, when she visited Pakistan on a royal tour back in 2019.
