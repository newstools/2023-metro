Wout Weghorst has revealed why he touched the ‘This is Anfield’ sign prior to Manchester United’s 7-0 defeat to Liverpool after facing fierce criticism. United fans turned on him after footage emerged of Weghorst touching the famous sign before the Red Devils were humiliated by Jurgen Klopp’s side. Weghorst has been a surprise part of United’s recent success, with the Dutchman joining the club in January on loan from Burnley to replace Cristiano Ronaldo. Despite scoring just once, Weghorst has proved popular with supporters for his tireless work-rate and his ability to bring the likes of Marcus Rashford into play. But Weghorst appears to have undone a lot of his hard work after footage emerged of him touching the ‘This is Anfield’ sign – synonymous with United’s arch-rivals Liverpool – which did not go down well with fans of the Red Devis. Weghorst took to Instagram on Tuesday to address the incident as he posted: ‘Normally I never react on media topics, but for this one it’s worth it because you amazing United fans are important to me. ‘So I just want to clarify the video that is doing the rounds. From the national team I know that Virgil always touches that sign and I went to stop him touching it to try and wind him up before the game. ‘As a child I always supported FC Twente, and as a player now for Manchester United, my dedication to this incredible club can never be questioned. ‘Sunday was a terrible day for all of us, we are putting everything into making it right in the next weeks. We will bounce back together and achieve our aims this season.’ United will be looking to put things right when they return to action on Thursday as they face Real Betis in the last 16 of the Europa League.
