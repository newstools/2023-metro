A woman has been hit with a furious backlash from Northerners after she drew a map placing Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool in ‘the South’. Michelle Bayly took to Twitter to show her map of the England and Wales, which she has divided into three – the North, the Midlands, and the South. However her geographical skills have left many outraged – especially as she said Leeds was where the North began. She wrote: ‘Can we all agree that North is Leeds and above? ‘North of London doesn’t mean North.’ The viral post has lead to some severe criticism by some whose northern powerhouses have been placed – wrongly – in the Midlands. Steven Lally wrote: ‘I think the idea that Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Hull aren’t in the North is slightly mad.’ ‘Lol imagine complaining that Londoners don’t know where the North is and then putting out a map that put Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield in the Midlands – incredible stuff,’ @craigthulhu added. Others even argued that the North began in Nottingham – a city which is widely regarded as being firmly in the Midlands. ‘I’d say Nottingham and above is north, but I’d agree to this compromise,’ wrote @SarahJRandom Michelle eventually conceded, and went for an easier method of measuring whether a city was in the North or not. She wrote: ‘After deep thought and consultation I have decided to scrap my map of  North, Middle and South and instead go with the popular opinion that if you have gravy on chips then you are definitely Northern (no matter the geography).’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
