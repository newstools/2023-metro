Micah Richards slammed Antony and was left ‘confused’ by the Manchester United star’s performance in the 7-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. Antony played the full 90 minutes as United were destroyed by their arch-rivals at Anfield in a historic loss. The Brazil international, who moved to Old Trafford in a £85m deal this summer, picked up a yellow card in the 53rd minute and former Manchester City defender Richards was unimpressed with his lack of support to Diogo Dalot. ‘There was no communication between Dalot and Antony,’ Richards told Match of the Day 2. ‘At times, it was like they were playing with 10 men because Antony was not doing his work at all down that side. ‘I don’t know if it was tactical, Antony’s positioning… I was confused at what he was doing. ‘I don’t know if it was him being lazy or the manager told him to stay up for counter-attacks. ‘If I’m Dalot, I would be screaming at [Antony] to come and help me. When they lose the ball, he just walks! ‘We’re talking about the biggest game for Man Utd this season… He was in absolute no-man’s land. I think it was him not helping out his team-mates.’ Antony has made 13 Premier League appearances for United this season and despite scoring three goals he is yet to register his first top-flight assist. It is not the first time the 23-year-old has faced criticism this term with Gabriel Agbonlahor labelling him a ‘bluffer’ and calling his turn trick ’embarrassing’. ‘When I look at Antony… £85 million pounds… I think he is a bluffer,’ Agbonlahor said last month. ‘I think when he gets the ball he doesn’t take anyone on, he hasn’t got the speed to take anyone on. He does this turn [trick] as well… It’s embarrassing and he needs to liven up.’ MORE : Rio Ferdinand sends message to Man Utd players after 'absolute massacre' at Anfield MORE : Luke Shaw reveals what Man Utd squad will do after 7-0 defeat to Liverpool
