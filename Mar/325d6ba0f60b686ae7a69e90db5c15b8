Rapper Constantinos Tsobanoglou, best-known by his stage name Costa Titch, has died at the age of 28. His death was confirmed by his family, who shared a tribute on social media after the South African musician was filmed collapsing on stage during a performance. ‘Death has tragically knocked at our door. Robbing us of our beloved son, brother and grandson, Constantinos Tsobanoglou (28), who South Africa had come to love and idolize under his stage name “Costa Titch”. It is with deep pain that we find ourselves having to acknowledge his passing at this time,’ his loved ones wrote. ‘We are thankful for the emergency responders and all those present in his last hours on this earth. As a family we are faced with a difficult time as we try to make sense of what has befallen us and ask that we be afforded the time and space to gather ourselves. ‘The Tsobanoglou family thanks you for the love and support you have given to our son and may you continue to uplift him even in spirit. Please keep us in your prayers and uplifted in the Lord.’ Before his family released the statement confirming his death, footage circulated on social media of Tsobanoglou performing at the Ultra Music Festival at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg. The musician was seen falling to the ground before getting back up, before collapsing again in front of the crowd. Tributes have poured in for the late rapper, with former Strictly Come Dancing professional dancer Oti Mabuse commenting on Instagram: ‘Rest in peace 😢.’ Musical ensemble Major League DJz wrote: ‘This is so sad..💔 Rest Well My G.’ Artist Frank Càsino also said: ‘eiisshhh… Rest easy bro💚🕊️,’ while actor and former beauty contestant Wema Sepetu penned: ‘This is Sad… RIP Costa Titch… Gone too soon…🕊️🕊️🕊️.’ A couple of days ago, Tsobanoglou shared a post revealing that his latest music video for his song Enjoyment with Buzzi Lee had just come out. Last month, fellow South African rapper AKA, real name Kiernan Jarryd Forbes, died aged 35. Tsobanoglou shared a tribute on social media to his friend and peer at the time, posting a broken heart emoji on Instagram alongside a compilation of pictures and videos. He later wrote: ‘Still doesn’t feel real… Love you forever big bro!’ Got a story?
