A tiny ‘half bench’ was installed by a council and locals have already branded it a ‘joke’. More than 100 people in Basingstoke, Hampshire, previously signed a petition asking Old Basing & Lychpit Parish Council to install a bench outside Tesco. People wanted to ‘a seat of rest for those who may have difficulty walking the distance from their home to the shops and back’. The council agreed but it was certainly not what the community had in mind, with some labelling it a ‘joke’. The bench is comically small and can only fit one person on it. Councillor Elaine Still said they decided on the size to deter rough sleepers and prevent vandalism. She told the Basingstoke Gazette: ‘The reason I wouldn’t agree to a full bench is because we can’t afford to have rough sleepers back.’ She added the bench was approved as a ‘compromise with the proviso that the seat would be bolted into the ground and be virtually vandal-proof due to previous instances of vandalism in this area’. Martin Peer, 76, who lives in the area, said: ‘It’s madness having only one seat. I can understand the argument if you have a larger seat it seems to encourage people to sleep on it. ‘I would think that people wouldn’t want that around here. ‘But we ought to have provision for people to sleep in proper places rather than be forced to sleep on a bench.’ The county council said it gave permission to the parish council to select, purchase and arrange the seat of their choice.
