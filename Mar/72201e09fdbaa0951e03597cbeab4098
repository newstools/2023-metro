Overlooking the Caribbean shores of Aruba stands a series of crumbling homes. They make up the abandoned ‘ghost village’ that once was home to a bustling community on the coastline. An old cafe called ‘Coco Loco Ranch,’ even still has its boards and tables left behind. The remains of houses have been left behind and blanketed in a thick layer of sand. Furniture, such as sofa and beds, have been marooned there. Over time, the wind has blown loose sand into the houses, onto the buildings, and covered any rotting furniture. Shaun, who lives in northern Nevada, US, visited the ghost village earlier this month and took a haunting set of photos. The 30-year-old told Jam Press: ‘In short, we stumbled across these shacks which stretch along the length of a mostly unused beach on the far opposite side of the island from the tourism centre. ‘No one we asked has any concrete information on it, or even knew it was there.’ In one image, a sofa can be seen inside of a home, covered in sand, rips, and dirty marks. In another shot, an old advertisement billboard can be seen on the back of what likely used to be a bar or restaurant, looking out of place in the beach surroundings. One photo shows an all round view of the whole village, along the broad coastline and with the stunning ocean in view, however, its emptiness gives an eerie feeling. Shaun, who runs Raise The Stakes Photography, added: ‘These shacks and cabins were built to varying degrees in solidness – most with discarded wood, pallets, metal and even old vinyl advertising billboards.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
