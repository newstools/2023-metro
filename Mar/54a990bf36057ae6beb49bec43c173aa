The Princess of Wales wore an Alexander McQueen red coat with black accessories for an outing today, as she arrived in Combermere Barracks in Windsor to attend the St David’s Day Parade today. She paired the striking scarlet coat with a black fascinator (which appears to be the Bow Arrow style from Juliette Botterill Millinery), a Mulberry handbag, gloves by Cornelia James, and knee-high Gianvito Rossi boots – which she also wore yesterday in Wales. Kate also sported a leek broach that’s a replica of one adored by her late grandmother-in-law, the Queen. The original Welsh Guards Leek Brooch was designed for Queen Elizabeth II in 1960. Today’s high-end look is a departure from the high-street fashion choices Kate has been wearing of late. The internet went wild for her £18 Zara earrings she wore at the Baftas and she was spotted yesterday in a £20 Zara houndstooth skirt. The print seems to be a current favourite of the royals – as she was seen in red houndstooth at the England vs Wales Six Nations clash at the weekend. Kate and husband Prince William looked to be in good spirits today as they visited the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards for the St David’s Day Parade. This will be Prince William’s first parade since he became the Colonel of the Welsh Guards. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
