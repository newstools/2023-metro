A driver has died after the £250,000 Ferrari he was in veered off a road, hit a tree and overturned. Emergency services arrived to find the flipped Ferrari F8 Tributo on its roof beside the A630 outside Doncaster. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene just before 9am on Sunday. He has not been formally identified, but police said he was aged in his 30s. Footage from the crash site shows a flatbed truck using a crane to retrieve the mangled car between the row of trees along the carriageway. The Ferrari was totally wrecked in the crash, which caved in the roof. South Yorkshire Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward. A spokesperson said: ‘Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who was driving in the area at the time and has dash cam footage which captured the vehicle before the collision to come forward to see if you can assist with the enquiries.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
