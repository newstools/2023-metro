Westminster Abbey will shut its doors to the public in April as it prepares to get everything ready for King Charles III’s Coronation. The Coronation will take place on Saturday, May 6, with plenty of celebrations planned around the landmark event. And with preparations well underway, Westminster Abbey will play an integral role in the ceremony. It’s where the King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla will be crowned as King and Queen. It means the royal church won’t be open for visitors and worshippers from April 25 until May 8. Westminster Abbey will make visitor tickets for May – July available in the coming weeks. Monarchs have been crowned at Westminster Abbey since 1066, when the Coronation of William the Conqueror took place. Since then, a further 38 reigning monarchs have been crowned at the Abbey. Elsewhere, the BBC recently confirmed it would pause the licence fee temporarily to allow venues to screen the event. The ceremony at Westminster Abbey and the special concert at Windsor Castle can both be screened on May 6 and 7 without needing to fork out for an annual licence. The BBC stressed the dispensation is granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’, with the event needing to be of ‘national importance’ and screened in a community setting. Examples cited by TV licensing include churches, town halls, cinemas and concert and performing arts venues. Charles’s coronation is the first to be staged in the country for 70 years and it will see the royal anointed and crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury in front of more than 2,000 guests. The Queen Consort will also be anointed and crowned in a simpler ceremony during the coronation service. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
