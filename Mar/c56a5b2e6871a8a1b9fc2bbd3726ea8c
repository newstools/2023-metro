One of Britain’s best beaches was turned into a crime scene after the body of a dead dolphin washed up. A cetacean stranding organisation is now investigating what caused the death of the animal found in South Shields. Steven Lomas, 36, was left in shock when he spotted the body during his morning walk at Sandhaven. ‘I was walking along the coast before work at 6.35am and noticed something on the beach with a large amount of seagulls nearby,’ he recalled. ‘The beach was Sandhaven Beach, which was voted Britain’s best beach last year. ‘At first, I thought it was stranded, but realised it was dead. It is sad to see, but I am more interested in what happened to it. ‘Physically, it looked in good shape but something could have killed it like pollutants, boats, plastics or could have died of natural causes.’ Steven reported the incident to British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), which then alerted the Cetacean Stranding Investigation Programme. ‘They will work with Newcastle University to retrieve the body for a post mortem examination at a later date,’ a statement added. In January, four young dolphins washed up dead on beaches near Aberystwyth and Tywyn, in Wales, prompting an investigation from authorities to confirm if there is any possible link.
