This dog has what people are describing as ‘human lips’ as he often appears to pucker up for his owner from across the room. Laura Boehmke first welcomed ‘freaky’ German short-haired pointer Griffin into her home back in 2020. The 50-year-old sales and quality manager noticed the ‘sweet’ mutt would get his lips stuck on his teeth – making it look like he has had lip filler. In the video clip, mum-of-three Laura catches cheeky Griffin peering over her with human-like lips before he cocks his head as if showing off his unusual look. Laura, from Long Island, in New York, US, said: ‘It literally does look like he’s blowing kisses to you. It’s very weird. ‘Every once in a while, I turn around and look at him and happen to catch it. He looked over at me and I thought I had to get my camera. ‘Some people have said it looks like Ben Stiller in Zoolander, the Maybelline commercial, Kylie Jenner, lip filler. All kinds of stuff. ‘People have asked if it’s a filter but it’s real. It happens every so often. ‘It’s not a filter – it’s just a freak thing that happens.’ The ‘sweet’ dog is likely experiencing this from his teeth getting stuck to his lips, but Laura’s never been able to properly check. She said: ‘I’ve never been up close enough to see what’s going on. His lips get stuck on his teeth. It’s something that he does. ‘I know they’re getting caught on the side somehow but he puckers up with the way it happens. ‘It’s not like that all the time. Sometimes it’s just the bottom lip, the top lip or both.’ The videos she shares of him are very popular, with them getting over 3 million views. One viewer commented: ‘That dog has lip filler, girl.’ Another TikTok user said: ‘Looks like he’s giving Zoolander’s Blue Steel look.’ Do you have a story to share?
