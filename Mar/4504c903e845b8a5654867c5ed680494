A young child has died in a crash in an ‘unimaginable tragedy’ in Northern Ireland. Witnesses have suggested that a lorry crashed into a grandmother crossing the road with a pram close to traffic lights in Moira. The child was killed, while the woman became trapped under the vehicle on Wednesday afternoon. People rushed to help and the gran was rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital in a critical condition. Councillor Jim Dillon said he’d been informed of the circumstances of the horrific incident, which had come as a ‘dreadful shock’ to the local community. Noting that he knew the lorry driver, he added: ‘I want to express my deepest sympathies to the family concerned and to the lorry driver. It is an absolute tragedy that nobody could have envisaged.’ An Alliance Party MLA said that she was ‘devastated’ for the family involved. ‘My heart is just broken for them and I know we will all hold the family in prayer over the next while, God bless them all. Just devastating’, Sorcha Eastwood said on Twitter. In a Facebook post, DUP MLA Paul Givan said it was ‘absolutely devastating news’ and that his thoughts and prayers were with the families affected by ‘this unimaginable tragedy’. A community group is planning on starting a fundraiser for the family. Pretty Mary’s bar in the town said on social media that it would close on Thursday as a mark of respect following the tragedy. Main Street was closed after the collision, but reopened in the early hours of this morning. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
