Aldi has owned up to selling Easter treats that… don’t exactly look like bunnies. Shoppers were left giggling when similarities between the shop’s Marshmellow Bunnies and Chicks and a certain part of the male anatomy were pointed out. The budget supermarket has owned up to the ‘c**k up’, joking that they have ‘no defence on this one’. A Twitter user pointed out the likeness in a viral post, saying: ‘Sorry Aldi, but that ain’t a Bunny’. Other amused social media users were quick to agree, with one woman named Nicole writing ‘Bunnies & chicks = d***s’. Someone named Jo quipped ‘it’s an Easter Rising’, while another person said ‘Loving Aldi’s new Erotic sweets range’. Aldi’s representatives were up for a laugh on Twitter, telling one person to ‘behave themselves’ after they said they’d ‘take five bags’. Liam Hayne wrote: ‘I’d love to think that everyone noticed this apart from the person in charge, and they all mutually agreed not to say anything’. He could be on the right track with Aldi jokingly replying ‘No comment’ to someone who told them: ‘You didn’t even try to make it a bunny did you’. Specsavers even got involved in the online fun, saying it ‘could be time to pop in’. Meanwhile, one parent jested that ‘an Easter hunt at the local primary school is gonna be interesting in the next few weeks’. ‘I bought these for my 7-year-old daughter! Ooops Aldi’, added someone named Michelle. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
