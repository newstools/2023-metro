La Liga president Javier Tebas claims Barcelona will not be able to sign players this summer. The Spanish spent in excess of €150 million last summer on signing Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde, while Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie, Hector Bellerin and Marcos Alonso arrived on free transfers. Barcelona were under pressure to trim their squad last summer but only managed to offload Philippe Coutinho and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while another high earner, Memphis Depay, joined Atletico Madrid in the January window. According to Tebas, Barcelona remain in a poor financial position and the club will be prevented from registering new players until more players are offloaded. ‘As of today, Barcelona doesn’t have any room in its budget to spend in the upcoming transfer window,’ Financial Times’ Business of Football summit in London on Thursday. ‘Barcelona has been involved in questionable behaviour which has had an impact on La Liga and we are acting accordingly. ‘We have ruled that they can no longer sign more players. ‘They sold off €700 million in TV rights and tried to find different ways to solve the situation but they won’t be able to do that next season. ‘We have strict economic controls. At the end of each window, we tell all the clubs in LaLiga what they can spend. ‘In the case of Barcelona, they have to drop from spending on wages and transfers from €650m to €450m – so it’s a budget of minus €200m. ‘They have to reduce their investment in players and we have encouraged them to sell players because for every amount they raise in sales they can spend 40 per cent of that.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
