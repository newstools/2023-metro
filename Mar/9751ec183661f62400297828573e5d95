A burst water main led to spectacular scenes in Nottinghamshire this afternoon. Water shot around 50ft into the air and homes were engulfed within a matter of minutes. Residents in the town of Beeston later told how rocks whizzed through the air and water flooded through windows at terrifying speed. Families in ten properties had to be evacuated as a result of the burst water main. Kathleen Collins, 99, had to be rescued from her home in Audon Avenue by firefighters. She told the BBC: ’I’ve lived here since 1939 and have never seen anything like it. ‘I realised something was wrong when the drains in the garden started lifting.’ Jessica Stratford had her dog Cassie rescued by fire crews. She told the BBC: ‘She was already a rescue at one [year old], so this is the second rescue of her life and she is 16 now.’ Workers from Severn Trent and emergency services had raced to the scene where, armed with sandbags, they have tried to contain the water. Roads were closed and some transport links disrupted as a result of the deluge. Severn Trent told local media the leak had been caused by the actions of a third party. A spokesperson said: ‘A third party has caused damage to one of our larger pipes as they were working on a building site in Beeston. Our teams are continuing to work in the area to minimise disruption. ‘Customer water supplies are currently not affected, and we’re working on the network to help keep supplies on during the repair, as well as bringing tankers to the area.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
