A Catholic priest has been jailed for abusing a young girl over a three-year period in the 1980s. Dennis Finbow was working in Dogsthorpe, in Peterborough, when he asked the child to take her clothes off before touched her inappropriately. The 74-year-old was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault against the girl, who was aged between 10 and 13. He was sentenced earlier today at Cambridge Crown Court to six years and six months in prison. Detective constable Annette Renwick said after Finbow’s sentencing: ‘I am pleased he has finally faced justice. ‘He subjected the victim to shocking sexual abuse which can leave serious lifelong psychological scars. ‘His role was that of a person in a position of trust, a person many parishioners admired but who also trusted him with their children. That trust he abused. ‘The victim showed immense bravery to not only come forward, but also support us with a prosecution and give evidence in court, which takes a huge amount of strength and courage.’ Finbow, now of Bealings Road, Martlesham, Suffolk, was also told he would be on the sex offenders’ register for life.
