Rihanna cradled her growing baby bump while waving at the cameras as she made her grand entrance to the Oscars 2023. The Umbrella superstar, 34, confirmed that she’s pregnant with her second child in February during her Super Bowl halftime show after mounting speculation within the first few seconds of her performance. Like many of our favourite celebrities, including Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, and Paul Mescal, Rihanna, who is performing at tonight’s 95th Academy Awards, posed for photographs ahead of the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Wearing a black leather cut-out gown over the top of a high-neck mesh dress, she flashed a huge smile while gently placing her hand on her stomach. The eye-popping number showed her tummy on full display. In February, a rep for Rihanna confirmed to various media outlets she is expecting her second child with boyfriend A$AP Rocky. The couple is already parents to a son who was born in May 2022. Rihanna gave fans an even closer glimpse of her growing baby bump in a photo circulating on social media showing the soon-to-be mum-of-two cradling her stomach backstage at the halftime show. Rihanna will perform her Oscar-nominated song Lift Me Up, written for Marvel’s blockbuster sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, at tonight’s ceremony. The song picked up a nod for best original song, alongside Lady Gaga’s Hold My Hand from Top Gun: Maverick, and is Rihanna’s first Oscar nomination. Lift Me Up has already earned Rihanna multiple nominations throughout the 2023 awards season, including at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. Got a story?
