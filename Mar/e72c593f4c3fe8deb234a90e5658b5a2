Royalists to the front, as you can now stay in a helicopter that’s been piloted by Prince William. Two Sea King helicopters – which served in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force as Search and Rescue helicopters – have been transformed into rental properties. The vibrant vessels sit just two miles from the centre of Scarborough and boast plenty of history. One of them served in the Falklands, and the other was piloted by Prince William. Prince William joined the RAF Search and Rescue Force in 2009 and served as a full-time pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance from 2015 until 2017. This glamping experience sleeps up to two adults and three children, coming in at £159 per night. With a minimum booking of two nights, this stay offers an experience and fantastic local activities such as fishing, bowling and riding on a steam boat. It’ll certainly make for an interesting stay – and for something a little different. You could even recreate the shots of Prince William, if you’re so inclined. ‘Their transformation into sleek, “wow-factor” glamping pods involved a great deal of care and expertise,’ reads the listing. ‘Fully insulated and heated, the clean-lined Nordic-style interiors include rustic light-wood flooring, pot plants, and cheerful flashes of colour. ‘In case you were wondering, the pilot’s dashboard is fully restored and intact – perfect for kids both big and little.’ You can book the stay on Hot Unusual.
