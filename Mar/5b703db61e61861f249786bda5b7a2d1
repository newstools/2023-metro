Roy Keane took aim at West Ham and ‘the Spurs’ of this world’ following Manchester United’s 3-1 victory in the FA Cup on Wednesday evening. United came from behind at Old Trafford to secure their latest win and a place in the FA Cup quarter-final where they will play Fulham. West Ham had plenty of chances to score more than once against United as Michail Antonio had two one-on-one opportunities saved by David De Gea. After going a goal down, United went on to score three goals and Keane was furious with the manner of West Ham’s second-half display accused David Moyes’ players of getting ‘giddy’ from their first-half performance. When asked if he felt West Ham would cause an upset in the second half, Keane told ITV Sport: ‘No, it never happens, seen it all before. ‘They come, they get a bit giddy, they have opportunities. ‘Loads of teams, not just West Ham, the Spurs’ of this world, they come to Old Trafford, they have a little bit of possession, one or two chances, they’re all excited. ‘They get plaudits, then they end up getting beaten. ‘Defensively, West Ham were shocking, absolutely useless in the second half, giving up three goals. ‘Give Man United all the credit, we knew there would be a reaction, we spoke about it at half time, the really good teams find a way to win. ‘That’s what they’ve done, set-piece delivery, we saw that at the weekend, contributions from subs, Fred scoring. No surprises with what we’ve seen tonight. ‘I’ve seen it over the years, it’s laughable.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
