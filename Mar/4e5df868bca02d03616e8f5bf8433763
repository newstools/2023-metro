Will Smith has reportedly been left feeling ’embarrassed’ and hurt’ over jokes made by Chris Rock in his Netflix special, after the notorious Oscar’s slap last year. In case you’ve forgotten, the historic moment saw Fresh Prince megastar Will slap Chris onstage after he made a joke about Will’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith suffering from alopecia. ‘Keep my wife’s name out [of] your f*****g mouth,’ Will said after striking him, leading to The Academy condemning his behaviour and launching a formal investigation that resulted in him being banned from the ceremony for ten years. Chris has since remained tight lipped over the ordeal, but in his new Netflix stand-up show, Chris Rock: Selective Outrage, he didn’t hold back. In the hour-long special, Chris says: ‘The thing people wanna know … did it hurt? Hell yeah, it hurt. He played Muhammad Ali! ‘I played Pookie (in ‘New Jack City’). Even in animated movies, I’m a zebra, he’s a f*****g shark. I got hit so hard, I heard Summertime ringing in my ears.’ He elsewhere spoke about how the title for his Netflix special had connections to Will and poked fun at the actor’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith making the bombshell admission in 2020 that she had an ‘entanglement’ with singer August Alsina while she and Will were on a break, a revelation the pair later discussed on her Red Table Talk show. ‘Will Smith practices selective outrage. Everybody that really knows knows I had nothing to do with that s***. I didn’t have any entanglements,’ Chris told the audience who were in hysterics throughout the whole bit. He continued: ‘His wife was f****** her son’s friend. Now, I normally would not talk about this s***, but for some reason, these n***** put that s*** on the internet. I have no idea why two people that talented would do something that low-down. ‘We all been cheated on. Everybody in here has been cheated on. None of us have ever been interviewed by the person that cheated on us on television. None of us. … Why the f*** would you do that s***? She hurt him way more than he hurt me, okay?’ However, the comments haven’t gone down well with Will, who is said to be keen for Grown Ups star Chris to ‘let it go’. A source told Entertainment Tonight: ‘Will is embarrassed and hurt by what Chris said about him and his family in his Netflix special.’ The insider added that Will had not yet seen the show, but comments are ‘everywhere when you look online and on social media’. They continued: ‘Will apologised to Chris and would like for Chris to let it go. Will has worked on himself and he is banned by the Oscars for 10 years.’ ‘He is upset that Netflix gave Chris this platform to share these messages and thinks it’s distasteful,’ they added. Shortly after the notorious incident, Will shared a video in which he apologised to the former SNL comedian. In the clip, the Bad Boys star said he had been hurt both ‘psychologically and emotionally’ by the incident. He said: ‘It’s all fuzzy. I will say to you, Chris, I apologise to you. My behavior was unacceptable and I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk. ‘I hate when I let people down. So it hurts, it hurts me psychologically and emotionally to know I didn’t live up to people’s image and impression of me. ‘And the work I’m trying to do is, I am deeply remorseful and I’m trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself. ‘I’m human and I made a mistake, and I’m trying not to think of myself as a piece of s**t.’ Metro.co.uk has approached Will’s reps for comment.
