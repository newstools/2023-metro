Rail workers in Greece have walked out in protest over safety after the country’s deadliest train crash for decades killed at least 57 people. National services and the subway in capital Athens were hit as they struck over working conditions and lack of modernisation in the network. Students and left wingers also joined demos. More than 50 people are still in hospital after Tuesday night’s crash, when a passenger express carrying 350 collided head-on at high speed with a freight train near the northern town of Larissa. Many victims were students travelling back to Thessaloniki from Athens after a holiday weekend. Carriages of the express were destroyed as a fireball erupted and sections of both trains were thrown from the track. A stationmaster arrested afterwards was due in court yesterday as a judicial inquiry tries to establish why the trains were on the same track. ‘Responsibility will be assigned,’ prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after visiting the scene. ‘We will work so the words “never again” will not be an empty pledge. That I promise you.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
