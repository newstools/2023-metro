Carlo Ancelotti believes it was ‘strange’ to see Barcelona play so defensively in their 1-0 win against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Thursday evening. Eder Militao’s first-half own goal sealed the victory for Barcelona in the first leg of their semi final at the Santiago Bernabeu. Madrid, meanwhile, failed to register a shot on target as Barcelona produced an impressive defensive display against the Spanish champions. And Ancelotti feels Barcelona’s performance moved away from their usual attacking style. ‘It’s been a bit strange to see them [Barcelona] play like this,’ Ancelotti said of Barcelona after Madrid’s defeat. ‘But they have been very solid, they have a collective commitment, and they have closed all the lines very well. ‘Having to attack them with crosses is not the best thing to do, as I said before. And they have led us to that.’ When asked if he felt Barca deserved to beat Madrid, Ancelotti replied: ‘No, it’s pretty obvious. ‘There have hardly been any occasions. I think it’s been one of our best games defensively all season.’ Meanwhile, Xavi believes Madrid are still favourites to progress to the final despite their defeat to Barca. ‘The 1-0 win gives us a certain advantage,’ Xavi said after the game. ‘But we are going to have to compete very well against a very strong Real Madrid side. I still see Madrid as a favourite.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
