A fire has destroyed a guinea pig sanctuary and caused £20,000 of damage to a nearby shed. Chris Woods and Diane Taylor, who live in Burgh Le Marsh near Skegness, realised the damage on Friday March, 3. The blaze had began at Sandy’s Guinea Pig Sanctuary next door to their home, which claimed the lives of 12 guinea pigs. A fundraiser has been launched in the wake of the tragedy. Police say a woman was arrested in connection with the fire and later bailed, with inquiries ongoing. Chris and Diane say they have lost around £10,000-worth of possessions as a result of the blaze. Their shed contained a collectable 1970s motorbike, gardening equipment, tools and pushbikes. Diane, 60, told LincolnshireLive: ‘It was absolutely horrendous. I was panicking like mad. ‘At the moment I am just gutted because of everything. We could have lost more, but we have lost so much of what was in the shed. ‘There’s so much gone.’ The couple fear a further £10,000 will be needed to repair the shed. Chris, 60, added: ‘I am not in the best of moods about it all, but what can I do? I am just in the hands of the insurance people.’ A spokesperson for Lincolnshire Police said: ‘We were called to a fire at a property on the Barnack Estate in Burgh le Marsh at around 7pm on Friday, March 3. ‘A 41-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the incident and has since been bailed. Our investigation continues.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
