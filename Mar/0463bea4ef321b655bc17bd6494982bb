Patients at a hospital in Sheffield were delighted to see a giant ‘get well soon’ message etched out in snow. The wintery weather in South Yorkshire may have caused travel chaos for some, but for those at Royal Hallamshire the inclement weather led to a message of hope. A ‘group of lads’ are thought to be behind the kind gesture, but have not yet come forward despite huge praise online. Their message was left on top of a car park opposite the hospital on Thursday. ‘Proper good job, thanks to those who did it,’ tweeted Paul Harris, 44, from Kidsgrove in Staffordshire. Mr Harris, who has pulmonary arterial hypertension and raises money for Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK, told the PA news agency he attends the Sheffield hospital roughly every six months for check ups. He was on the 13th floor when he spotted the message in the snow on Thursday. ‘It was decent!” he said. ‘I don’t know how many rooms have that view but it’s the main profile of the hospital so there must have been probably 100 windows at least it could be seen from, easily. ‘The amount of people who would have seen it is immense. So yeah, it was good!’ Sheffield was one of a number of locations in the UK which has been affected by the cold weather and snow. The Met Office had issued three amber warnings for northern England, the Midlands, North Wales and Northern Ireland, where ‘significant disruption’ to transport and power supplies was expected. Twitter user Joe Dawson was another who spotted the message from opposite the hospital, tweeting ‘To the lads that have done this on the car park at the Hallamshire, you’ve really cheered everyone on @NCCU-K1 up!
