A fishing boat was caught in the middle of a shark feeding frenzy, with the predators splashing and slamming up against the vessel. Countless sharks breached the surface of the ocean off the coast of Venice, Louisiana, feeding off a bait ball of packed small fish. A video of the spectacle showed shark fins for a distance in the water as the frenzied predators ate away at the prey. ‘God!’ people on board could be heard saying. ‘Soaking wet!’ a person remarked as ocean spray continued to burst up. About a dozen sharks barreled toward the boat as the bait ball tried to hide under it. Fisherman Dillon May and his girlfriend were on a friend’s boat about 15 miles off the coast, trying to catch yellowfin tuna. They first thought the commotion was a tuna boil, which refers to a feeding frenzy that makes the water look like it is boiling. ‘Then we saw it was sharks on a bait pod, never seen anything like it,’ May told Storyful. ‘No shrimp boats were in sight either!’ They sailed toward the menhaden pod, in hopes catching some themselves. ‘By the time we got there, the sharks had found the pod and pushed them up against the boat to feast on them,’ May said. The sharks were in such a mania that they splashed water onto the boat, May said. It is not the first time a shark feeding frenzy has been recorded. In 2016, drone footage captured the moment that dozens of tiger sharks fed on a humpback whale at Shark Bay in western Australia. About 70 sharks could be seen closing in on the massive whale, which was believed to have died before the sharks attacked. The clear blue water quickly became stained with a large cloud of dark blood. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
