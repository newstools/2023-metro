 The Oscars are back tonight, with Everything Everwhere all at Once and The Banshees of Insherin expected to win big. This year’s ceremony is the 95th of its kind, and hundreds of awards have been given out over the years. But just who has won the most Oscars since the ceremony first began? We’ve got a few facts right here… The biggest single Oscar winner in history is Walt Disney, who won 26 Oscars during the course of his career, from a total of 59 nominations. Walt won his awards between 1932 and 1969, with the majority in the best animated short category – winning that Oscar eight years in a row from 1931-1939. But he’s not the only one to hold a major Oscars accolade…  That honour goes to Katherine Hepburn, who won the best actress Oscar four times – for Morning Glory in 1933, Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner in 1967 and for The Lion In Winter in 1968, when she tied with Barbara Streisand (Funny Girl) for the prize. Hepburn’s final acting Oscar came for On Golden Pond in 1981. However Meryl Streep is closing in fast on her title, having won three acting Oscars (for Kramer vs Kramer in 1979, Sophie’s Choice in 1982 and The Iron Lady in 2011), and having been nominated an impressive 21 times. John Ford – best known for his classic Westerns – won the best director statuette four times, for The Informer (1935), The Grapes Of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941) and The Quiet Man in 1952. It’s a tie between Ben-Hur (1959), 1997’s Titanic and The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King (2003) all of which went home with 11 Oscars each. The Return Of The King pulled off an even more impressive feat by winning every single one of the 11 Oscars it was nominated for – although amazingly didn’t take home a single award in the acting categories, with the majority being for technical achievements. Spare a thought however for La La Land – which despite jointly holding the record for the most nominations along with Titanic and All About Eve (14 in total), missed out on the best picture prize (or at least almost won it until they realised they’d made a mistake).  Only three films have ever gone home with the Oscars for best film, director, actor, actress and screenplay. It Happened One Night was the first to pull off the feat in 1934, followed by One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest in 1975. The most recent to achieve the feat was The Silence Of The Lambs in 1992.
