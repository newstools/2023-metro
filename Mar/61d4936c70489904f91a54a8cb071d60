Erik ten Hag called his humiliated Manchester United stars into training for a dressing down after their capitulation against Liverpool on Sunday. The Red Devils suffered the biggest defeat in their Premier League history with a 7-0 loss at Anfield. It was a scoreline that nobody could have predicted but while the result was bad, the performance was even more worrying. United have been on a brilliant run of form and Ten Hag has revived the club after a rotten 12 months under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The side suffered bad defeats earlier in the season against Brentford and Manchester City, but Ten Hag’s man-management helped the side to recover after both occasions. It’s now down to the Dutchman to rouse his troops once again and he called the players into training today at 9am. Ten Hag was in his office at 7am, giving himself two hours to prepare how to deal with his players. After the defeat against Brentford, Ten Hag took his players on an 8-mile run – which was the distance that the Bees ran more than his side in the 4-0 defeat. With United playing every three days, it’s unlikely that Ten Hag will use that option this time around but there will likely be a frank and forensic look at what went wrong against Liverpool. United face Real Betis at Old Trafford on Thursday, meaning there’s little time to dwell on the defeat at Anfield. The loss ended United’s slim title hopes but they’re still battling in the FA Cup and Europa League, having already won the Carabao Cup this season.
