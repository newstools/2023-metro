A man was filmed snorting what appears to be cocaine off a friend’s bald head at a jam-packed West Ham football game. West Ham United say they have suspended the fans involved, pending an investigation. It is unclear when the incident took place, but the video was shared to social media on Thursday and showed a packed-out Olympic Stadium. In the footage, a man can be seen sprinkling the white substance onto the bald man’s head before snorting a line with a rolled up bank note. A footie fan can be heard shouting ‘it’s on your head, stay there’ while others shout ‘come on’ to a fan behind them. Laughter can be heard from other people in the stands as one fan said: ‘Wheey, go on, video that… Go on get in there.’ Another man added: ‘Let’s f**king have it. Irons, Irons.’ Fans also egg on the supporter as they use phrases like ‘go on John get in there’ and ‘have you done that yet John?’ A statement from West Ham reads: ‘The club is disgusted by the contents of the video and acted swiftly to identify the offenders. ‘In line with our zero-tolerance approach, details of the offenders were immediately passed on to the police, and all individuals had their season tickets suspended and are therefore unable to enter London Stadium and travel with the club for away fixtures. ‘Pending our own club investigation, this could lead to the offenders being banned indefinitely. ‘There is no place for this kind of behaviour.’ The Met Police has been contacted for comment by Metro.co.uk.
