A body has been found after three years of searching for a missing man in Wales. South Wales Police were called at 10.42 am today (Sunday) following the discovery by a community search party looking for long-term missing man Jamie Moreno. Mr Moreno, who was 48 at the time, disappeared after leaving his home in Cardiff around lunchtime on March 23, 2020. He was spotted by a friend later that day and the last sighting of him was that afternoon on CCTV from a nearby school. Last month, Mr Moreno’s sister Nilsa spoke about how he was struggling to cope with the death of their mum and stayed in the house for two years after she passed away. South Wales Police has now confirmed that members of the public searching for him have found a body in the district where he was last seen. Formal identification has yet to take place, but Mr Moreno’s family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. A spokesperson told Wales Online: ‘South Wales Police can confirm a body has been found in woodland in Pentwyn, Cardiff. ‘Police were called at 10.42am today (Sunday, March 12) following the discovery by a community search party looking for long-term missing man, Jamie Moreno. ‘Formal identification of the body has yet not been carried out as enquiries are ongoing at the scene. ‘The family of Jamie Moreno are being supported by specialist officers at this time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
