Chris Martin may be Gwyneth Paltrow’s ex-husband, but they’re still on the best terms. Gwyneth was keen to wish ‘the sweetest father and friend’ a happy birthday, as he celebrated turning 46. The Oscar-winning 50-year-old star shares two children, Apple and Moses, with the Coldplay frontman. On Thursday (March 2), she posted a selfie of the pair with the caption: ‘Happy birthday to the sweetest father and friend. we love you, cajm.’ Her 8.2million Instagram followers were living for the public display, as one commented: ‘I love that you two have remained friends! Says a lot about both of you!’ ‘Divorced couple goals for sure’, another penned. ‘Amazing role models for your children and avtually everyone tbh! 🙌❤️🙌’, hailed another. Gwyneth and Chris married in 2003, before announcing they were embarking on a ‘conscious uncoupling’ in March 2014. The former couple and co-parents, who have remained close since the split, used the phrase in a statement to announce their divorce, which was later finalised in 2016. Gwyneth later revealed that she and the Yellow hitmaker had been introduced to the phrase by a therapist, but admitted she initially thought it sounded ‘a bit full of itself, painfully progressive and hard to swallow’. Their full statement read at the time: ‘It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate. ‘We have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much we will remain separate.’ They added: ‘We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways we are closer than we have ever been.’ After the divorce, Gwyneth, who also runs the lifestyle brand Goop, went on to marry TV producer and screenwriter Brad Falchuk. The couple, who met on the set of musical drama series Glee in 2010, tied the knot in 2018 in a ceremony at The Hamptons in New York. In fact, Brad celebrated his birthday just one day before Chris. Celebrating her man on his special day, Gwyneth posted a sweet snap to Instagram with the caption: ‘He won’t see this as he’s not on social (another reason why he’s so cool) but let’s all wish him a happy birthday, anyway💙’ Got a story?
