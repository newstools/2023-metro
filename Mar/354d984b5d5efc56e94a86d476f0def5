Motorists were stuck in an unlikely traffic jam this morning after a runaway pig hogged the road. Traffic was brought to a halt after the large porker was spotted dodging vehicles on the A6121 at Ryhall, Lincolnshire. Photographer Jason Richardson, 29, snapped pictures of the animal as it wandered down the middle of the road just after 8am. He said: ‘I was walking along the path and noticed the traffic was at a standstill. ‘There are traffic lights at one end of the road but the cars weren’t moving even when it changed to green. ‘I heard an oinking sound and suddenly this large pig wandered down the road in front of a lorry without a care in the world. ‘Motorists were just watching in disbelief. ‘I watched it for about half-an-hour as it trotted in and out of the cars before it ran up to a grass verge and through a hedge. ‘It’s not something you see everyday but it’s a relief the pig wasn’t hurt. The road is very busy, especially during rush hour.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
