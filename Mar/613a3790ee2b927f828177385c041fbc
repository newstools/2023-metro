Romeo Lavia is being linked with some of the biggest clubs in the country, but the Southampton teenager insists he is not paying any attention to it at all. The 19-year-old only joined the Saints from Manchester City last year as he wanted more first team opportunities and he has got them on the south coast. The Belgian has done enough in his 20 appearances this campaign to attract the attention of the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea, with all three all considering summer bids, especially if Southampton get relegated. It would be easy for a young player to be distracted by such talk, but Lavia insists he is only thinking about performing for Southampton as they battle against the drop into the Championship. ‘I don’t read it because I just don’t think about it. I just enjoy my football and focus on what we have to do as a club,’ Lavia told Sky Sports. ‘Whatever is outside, it is not what I can control, so I don’t pay attention to that. Football, with how it goes, it goes so fast. ‘One moment you can be in the headlines and the next, you’re not. So the only thing to do is just be neutral, don’t think about it and get your head down and work.’ Lavia arrived from the Premier League champions last summer for £14m, signing a five-year contract, so he would not be available cheaply, even if the Saints did go down. Southampton sit bottom of the table, four points from safety and in dire need of a result when they host Leicester City on Saturday evening.
