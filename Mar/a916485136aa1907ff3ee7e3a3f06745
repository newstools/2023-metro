Police are urgently trying to trace the man’s movements and whereabouts. Detective Chief Superintendent James Conway, Basic Command Unit (BCU) commander for Central East Area, said: ‘This incident is once again, an example of the very real dangers our officers can be confronted with, at any time, as they ultimately work to protect and serve our communities. ‘It is entirely unacceptable that officers who are doing their job and conducting reasonable and legitimate enquiries should be assaulted in this disgraceful way. ‘We will ensure that both officers involved in this incident, who showed great bravery and professionalism, will receive the continuing support they need and deserve. ‘Meanwhile, our detectives are leading the investigation to find the person responsible.’ It follows after Metro UK broke news on Thursday of three prison officers being stabbed with a makeshift blade in an attack at HMP Belmarsh on Thursday.
