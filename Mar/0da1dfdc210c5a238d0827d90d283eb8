Roy Keane unleashed a furious rant at Manchester United’s senior players who ‘let the club down’ after their humiliating 7-0 defeat at Liverpool. United were ripped apart by Jurgen Klopp’s side as Liverpool recorded their biggest ever competitive win against the Red Devils. The result saw United suffer their joint-heaviest ever competitive defeat, alongside 7-0 losses to Wolves in 1931, Aston Villa in 1930 and Blackburn in 1926. United legend Keane was enraged by his old club’s performance as he told Sky Sports: ‘If I got beat 6-0 or 7-0, I’d go into hiding. I’d go missing for a few months. It really is that embarrassing. ‘A shocking day. The goal just after half time, it was game over. ‘The senior players were embarrassing, didn’t show any leadership skills. The goals they gave away were shocking. A tough day for United. ‘Thank god I’ve never been part of a team that’s been beaten by that much playing for Man United. ‘The players will be embarrassed, ashamed of their performance. When the going got tough they went missing. ‘When you go two goals down like that you’ve got to show some sort of pride, fight, spirit, they didn’t show any of that. ‘I never thought United were back to their very best. They’ve had some very good results. They’ve been giving teams chances – Leicester at home, West Ham. Teams have let them off the hook. ‘Liverpool didn’t let them off the hook and punished them. That’s where they were deserve credit. They were clinical, ruthless. They kept going and wanted more goals. ‘The senior players are the ones that let the club down today.’ United will look to recover as they return to action on Thursday with a match against Spanish side Real Betis in the last 16 of the Europa League.
