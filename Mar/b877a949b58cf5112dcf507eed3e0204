Described as an ‘incredibly gentle and happy dog’, lovely Bruno has found a home at last. Bruno, one, had been rescued from a life of neglect by an animal shelter called SPCA. He previously suffered from heartworm, a life-threatening condition, but thankfully he pulled through and won the hearts of everyone at the shelter. Samantha Ranlet, 29, from Raleigh, North Carolina, who works at the animal shelter where Bruno was rescued, said: ‘Bruno is an incredibly gentle and happy dog. ‘Despite having such a hard start to life and being treated with neglect, he is incredibly forgiving and has trusted all of us at SPCA Wake from day one.’ Down one ear, Bruno chewed off the same ear of his favourite toy while he was waiting to find a new home. Samantha said that the shelter team thought it was the cutest thing. She added: ‘We later learned that a lot of people’s pets with missing body parts will do the same thing to their toys. ‘Dogs with missing tails, limbs, ears, or eyes apparently have a habit of modifying their toys in the very same way. ‘We found this really interesting, and it made us wonder if Bruno knew.’ Now, both Bruno and his one-eared pal are now living their best lives with new owner, Levi, 26. ‘Bruno’s new owner saw our social media post about his one-eared toy and fell in love with his face,’ said Samantha. ‘When he came to meet him in person, he knew he was the one. ‘He’d been looking for a buddy and found that in Bruno’s sweet and resilient spirit.’ Do you have a story to share?
