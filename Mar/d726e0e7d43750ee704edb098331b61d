An iconic Regent’s Park mansion has hit the market for at least £300million – and it’s believed to be the most valuable home in the capital. That significantly large number would get you the very impressive 40-bedroom Holme mansion right on the banks of the lake. The mansion was first built to be the residence of property developer James Burton in 1818. Later down the line, it was leased by Bedford College before eventually becoming a private home again. If you want to live your Regency-era Bridgerton fantasy – and are obscenely wealthy, this could be the perfect house for you. The property is being marketed by Knight Frank and Beauchamp Estates, according to the Telegraph. But sadly there’s no public listing available for us to have a snoop inside (not surprising, considering such high-end homes are often kept on a ‘need to see’ basis).Still, we do have some info about the home. The very impressive property spans three storeys, including a basement, and overlooks the park’s picturesque lake. If it is sold for the expected value price, it would far exceed the purchase of a £210million property in 2020 in Knightsbridge by Chinese billionaire Cheung Chung-kiu as the most costly home in London. The Regent’s Park property has been owned by the Saudi royal family since 2015, but it’s reportedly gone into receivership amid efforts at cost-cutting by the current crown prince.
