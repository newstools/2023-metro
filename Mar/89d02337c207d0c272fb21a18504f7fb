Iran’s president has sounded the alarm after hundreds of girls were poisoned by noxious gas – as officials suspect attackers are targeting female education. President Ebrahim Raisi has ordered authorities to investigate and make their findings public after almost 700 schoolgirls at around 30 institutions have been affected since November. Officials had initially downplayed the wave of incidents, which left children in hospital with headaches, heart palpitations, lethargy or being unable to move. Some have described smelling tangerines, chlorine or cleaning agents. Iran has already been rocked by rallies demanding women’s freedom, sparked by Mahsa Amini’s death in police ­custody. But unlike neighbouring Afghanistan, the nation has no history of shutting down girls’ education. Last month, residents staged ­protests in Qom – the city first hit by the attacks. ‘You are obliged to ensure my children’s safety! I have two daughters,’ one father could be heard saying in footage shared online. And the BBC reported a woman shouting: ‘This is a war! They want girls to stay at home.’ Mr Raisi told Iran’s interior, health and intelligence ministries to investigate, as he publicly addressed the poisonings for the first time, state-run news reported. A deputy health minister said unnamed people wanted girls’ schools to close. The night before Mr Raisi’s cabinet meeting, deputy interior minister Majid Mirahmadi dismissed the crisis as ‘stress, rumour and psychological war started by hostile TV channels’.
