Aldi has revealed it wants to expand by another 40 stores, with 30 of them already pegged to ideal locations across the UK. Already there are more than 990 Aldi stores across the UK, but the supermarket chain wants to reach 1,200 eventually to make Aldi more accessible to Brits – especially when times are hard financially. Hopeful new destinations for the lower-cost supermarket are said to include Oxford, Harrogate, Bath, York, St Albans and Dorchester. This expansion will see 6,000 new jobs created too, and many older stores in the north and midlands are due for refurbishment. Giles Hurley, Aldi UK chief executive, said that ‘demand for Aldi has never been higher’. Giles added that there are ‘still some towns and areas that either don’t have access to an Aldi or have the capacity for additional stores. ‘To meet that demand, we need to open more stores and it’s our mission to keep driving our ambitious expansion plan to achieve that.’ They recently announced that London alone would see 60 more stores open as well.
