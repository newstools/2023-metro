A savvy DIY fan has shared how she gave her 1930s old fashioned bathroom a modern and stylish makeover on a tight budget. Ali Buckley, from Hampshire, shared the results on her TikTok channel @shemadehome. Amazingly, the transformation cost just £25. The content creator updated the bathroom using a roll of £13 vinyl, matt black paint costing £9.99, and paint she already had. In the clip’s caption she wrote: ‘When you have a boring bathroom and a small budget this is what you do.’ Since being posted, the video has received 870,000 views and 119,000 likes on the platform. Then, in another post, Ali shared the steps to recreate her bathroom makeover yourself. She explained that she covered her MDF vanity units in Terrazzo pattern self-adhesive vinyl from B&Q. Two rolls cost her just £13. Meanwhile, she purchased a pot of RustOleum matt black paint and painted over the exisiting colourful tiles for £9.99. Ali told users that this particular paint is very hard-wearing. She also used light wood-effect vinyl wrap and painted the walls with orange and grey paint that she already owned. To finish the space, she added modern baskets and plant pots to add extra depth and interest. Those in the comments were surprised to learn that the interior renovation was completed on such a budget. ‘This is stunning wow! Amazing job,’ praised one user. While another added: ‘Doesn’t look like a small budget. Looks amazing.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
