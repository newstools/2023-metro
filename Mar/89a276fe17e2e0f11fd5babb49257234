Brendan Fraser has won the best actor gong at the Oscars 2023 for his performance in The Whale. The 54-year-old actor was overcome with emotion as he took to the stage at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles to accept the accolade before Michelle Yeoh became the first Asian to win best actress. ‘So this is what the multiverse looks like,’ Fraser began. ‘I thank the Academy for this honour. Darren Aronofsky for throwing me a creative lifeline and hauling me aboard the good ship The Whale.’ Addressing his fellow best actor nominees, he continued: ‘You laid your whale-sized hearts bare… and it is my honour to be named alongside you in this category.’ Fraser went on to thank his family and sons, as well as his co-star in The Whale, Hong Chau. He continued: ‘I want to tell you that only whales can swim at the depths of the talent of Hong Chau.’ Following Fraser’s speech, it was announced that Yeoh had won the best actress award for her role in Everything Everywhere All At Once. She fought off competition from two-time Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, Ana De Armas, Andrea Riseborough, and Michelle Williams. Accepting her prize, the 60-year-old said: ‘For all the little boys and girls who look like me, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities. Dream big, dreams do come true. Ladies, never let anyone tell you you are past your prime. ‘I have to dedicate this to my mum, all the mums in the world because they are really the superheroes and without them, none of us would be here tonight. She’s 84 and I’m taking this home to her.’ She added: ‘This is history in the making.’ This year’s Oscars ceremony concluded with the sci-fi epic Everything Everywhere All At Once scooping the best picture prize.
