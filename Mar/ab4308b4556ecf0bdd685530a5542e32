Lewis Capaldi has told fans that he’s ‘devastated’ to announce the postponement of world tour dates. The Scottish crooner, 26, revealed on Tuesday that he’d been to see a voice specialist and had subsequently been diagnosed with Bronchitis. As a result, his upcoming dates in Zurich and Milan will no longer be going ahead. However, in his heartfelt message to fans, Lewis confirmed he’d already rescheduled the gigs. The hitmaker’s full statement read: ‘Zurich & Milan, I’m absolutely devastated to be typing this. ‘As lots of you know for the past few nights of tour I’ve been really struggling with my voice, last night in Stockholm I tried my best to sing through the show even with it feeling really uncomfortable because I was desperate not to let any of you down.’ The star continued: ‘I’ve just been to see a voice specialist in Sweden who’s told me I’ve got Bronchitis and that I should be on vocal rest for at least 3 days to give me any chance of not damaging my voice and being able to continue touring. ‘I’m so very sorry to say that means that the shows in Zurich tomorrow night and in Milan the day after will be postponed, I’ve already checked with the venues free days they can do as well as dates I can make it back over to play these sold out shows that I’ve been buzzing for so long! ‘Milan, the show will now be on Wednesday May 31st 2023 and Zurich the show will now be on the Wednesday 28th June 2023.’ Lewis went on: ‘All original tickets for the shows will be valid, you don’t need to do anything else. ‘Hate letting you all down and this is the last thing I want to be writing. Going to be doing everything I can with rest and medication to be ready for Barcelona onwards. ‘See you all soon.’ Get well soon, Lewis!
