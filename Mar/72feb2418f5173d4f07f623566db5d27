Kim Kardashian and her sisters are reportedly not invited to this year’s Met Gala. The Kardashians have been a staple at the glitzy fashion bash for many years now, however, event organiser Anna Wintour is said to be ‘cracking down’ on the guestlist. Kim’s Met looks have become particularly headline-grabbing over the past few years and it’s hard to imagine the red carpet without the 42-year-old Skims founder. To last year’s bash, doting mum Kim famously donned the iconic gown Marilyn Monroe wore to sing happy birthday to President John F Kennedy in 1962. One Met prior, she slipped into an all-black Balenciaga outfit that became the talk of the internet for weeks on end. But on Wednesday, Page Six reported that Vogue editor-in-chief Anna, 73, might not extend invites to the world’s most famous family this year. The outlet added that while Vogue refused to comment on the claims, someone close to the Kardashian-Jenner clan rubbished them. For her 2022 Met look, Kim revealed she went to extreme lengths to fit into Marilyn’s stunning dress in time for the Gala. Discussing her look at the time, Kim revealed the gown could not be altered at all, meaning that she had to complete a huge transformation to be able to wear it. ‘The dress was transported by guards and I had to wear gloves to try it on,’ she said. ‘I always thought she was extremely curvy. I imagined I might be smaller in some places where she was bigger and bigger in places where she was smaller. So when it didn’t fit me I wanted to cry because it can’t be altered at all.’ On her routine, she continued: ‘I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein. I didn’t starve myself, but I was so strict.’ Metro.co.uk has reached out to reps for Anna, Kim, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner for comment.
