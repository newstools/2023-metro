Last seen on our screens in 2019, Idris Elba’s DCI John Luther is back for a movie-length, Netflix-backed adventure. It’s a doozy too. Despite a slightly comical wig, Andy Serkis gives you the shivers as gleeful serial psycho-blackmailer David Robey, a shadowy man with such reach he manages to get Luther sent to jail in the first scenes after using his network to dig up the dirt on this ‘bad apple’. Fear not, though: Luther escapes, trying to stay one step ahead of his replacement, DCI Odette Raine (Cynthia Erivo), until they are, inevitably and reluctantly, forced to team up to thwart Robey’s sick, twisted, vengeful and long-gestated masterplan. With the original BBC show’s creator Neil Cross back driving the script, Fallen Sun successfully ramps up to the scale and scope required for a movie spin-off. Featuring the best Piccadilly Circus-set carnage scene since An American Werewolf In London, it makes fantastic use of its authentic outdoor locations. Unsurprisingly, the muscular Elba slots right back into his signature role, while Widows star Erivo matches his intensity. Terrific entertainment. 15.
