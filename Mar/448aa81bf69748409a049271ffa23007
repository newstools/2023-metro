Detectives have released an image of a man they want to speak to after an 82-year-old man was set on fire outside a west London mosque last month. The Metropolitan Police have released an image of the man, who allegedly doused the victim in a liquid believed to be petrol before setting him on fire using a lighter, at around 8pm on February 27. Detectives said he engaged the victim in conversation for around five minutes as they both left the West London Islamic Centre on Singapore Road in Ealing before launching the attack. He then walked away. The 82-year-old was taken to hospital, where he received treatment for severe burns to his face and arms. Detective Sergeant Steven Constable urged anyone who recognises the suspect to contact police. He said: ‘I know this will be an incredibly shocking incident for the community and we are carrying out a full investigation into what happened. ‘Understandably, there is a great deal of local concern in the wake of this incident and local officers have been carrying out reassurance patrols daily at the mosque. ‘We are continuing to work alongside the West London Islamic Centre who have been very supportive of our investigation and have been assisting us with our inquiries. ‘A key part of that is identifying the man in the image we have released. ‘I would also urge anyone who witnessed this incident and has not yet spoken to police to please get in touch.’ Anyone with information is urged to call police on 101 and give reference 6422/27FEB.
