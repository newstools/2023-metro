Temperatures plunged below -15C on Friday night as heavy snow brought treacherous conditions across parts of the country. The Met Office had yellow warnings in place covering large swathes of the country after Storm Larisa battered parts of the UK with gales and blizzards. Meteorologist Matthew Box said rain, sleet and snow would push north-eastwards across the country over the weekend, likely falling on the hills and mountains of the Pennines, the Cumbrian vales and some parts of Scotland. But he added the snowfall would be ‘nothing to the same extent as what we saw on Thursday’. The lowest temperature of minus 15.2C was recorded at Altnaharra in northern Scotland while the highest temperature of 5C was recorded in Swanage, Dorset, in the south of England. Heading into the weekend, the Met Office expects cloud and rain to spread north east on Saturday, turning to snow over high ground. Temperatures are set to be cold but becoming much milder for the west and south west. Then, rain, sleet, and snow will move north east with clear spells following from the west. There will be low levels of snow in the north but this is expected to be short-lived across central areas. A yellow snow and ice warning covers much of northern England and southern Scotland until 6am on Sunday. The Met Office warns that snowfall could cause travel disruption in the affected areas, with delays on roads stranding some vehicles and passengers. Bus services, train services and flights may also be delayed or cancelled. Untreated pavements and cycle paths might be impassable, leading to a risk of injury from slips and falls. The Met Office adds that there is a small chance of power outages in some affected areas. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
