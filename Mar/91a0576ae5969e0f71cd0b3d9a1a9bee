Gary Glitter is set to be sent back to jail after breaking the rules of his bail just one month after being released. The shamed popstar, 78, was caught trying to access the dark web according to The Sun. The Probation Service has tonight confirmed he has ‘been recalled to prison after a breach of his licence conditions’ a spokesperson said. He was caught in a photo published by the newspaper asking how to avoid detection when web browsing on a smartphone. Glitter – real name Paul Gadd- was freed from low-security HMP Verne, in Portland, last month after serving half of his 16-year sentence for sexually abusing three schoolgirls. Authorities said he was living under ‘some of the strictest licence conditions’ including a GPS tag and close monitoring by police and probation officers. Last month angry crowd sparked a disturbance at the entrance to Glitter’s halfway house after he was released from prison. Strict bail conditions he was supposed to follow included wearing a tag and telling police if he enters into a relationship with someone who has a child under 18. A Probation Service spokesperson said: ‘Protecting the public is our number one priority. That’s why we set tough licence conditions and when offenders breach them, we don’t hesitate to return them to custody.’ A source told The Sun: ‘The mood music is heading in one direction. ‘The Deputy PM has now taken a personal interest, as you would expect. ‘The pictures and comments in themselves are enough to have raised serious concerns.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
