An incredible video shows a bull shark casually enjoying the waves just a few metres away from a group of oblivious surfers. The drone footage starts off showing an idyllic day in Jupiter, Florida, with calm waves and clear water last Sunday. Multiple surfers clearly took advantage of the dreamy conditions and set out into the sea. Unfortunately for them, a large bull shark had the same idea. The animal can be seen making its way to shallower water before it is spotted scarily close to a surfer waiting to catch a wave. Although the shark is just a few metres away from those in the sea, it never makes contact or even gets noticed by the group. The man who filmed the clip, Paul Dabill, 48, said: ‘It was exciting to see a large shark share the water with the surfers. ‘The ocean was calm and clear and there was a nice swell coming in and lots of surfers in the water. ‘Upon launching my drone, I immediately spotted a large bull shark very close to the beach. ‘I followed the shark with my drone as it approached several surfers. Fortunately, the shark didn’t seem too interested in the surfers and kept going about its business.’ It is not uncommon to find bull sharks on the shorelines of beaches. They can weigh up to 200kgs and grow to almost 12 feet. They are considered to be very dangerous and part of the species which are known to attack humans – along with great whites and tiger sharks. On Wednesday, footage emerged of a fishing boat caught in the middle of a shark feeding frenzy off the coast of Venice, Louisiana. A video of the spectacle showed shark fins for a distance in the water as the frenzied predators ate away at the prey. About a dozen sharks barreled toward the boat as the bait ball tried to hide under it. The sharks were in such a mania that they splashed water onto the boat.
