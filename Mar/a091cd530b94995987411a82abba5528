Ever wondered what it’s like to feel Chaka Khan’s wrath? Well, just call her less of a great singer than the likes of Adele and Mariah Carey and you’ll certainly feel the burn. It’s been over two months since Rolling Stone released its controversial list of the 200 Greatest Singers, which inexplicably snubbed powerhouse vocalist Celine Dion, yet, Queen Chaka has only just learned of its existence. In a new interview, the 69-year-old singer was informed that she had ranked at number 29, and needless to say, she wasn’t best pleased. ‘I didn’t even know what the hell you were talking about, so obviously this don’t mean a great deal to me,’ she shot back before delivering another scathing remark: ‘These people don’t quantify or validate me in any way.’ However, she was interested in hearing which artists were placed ahead of her, replying when told Mariah, 53, received the high positon of number five: ‘That must be payola or some s**t like that,’ referring to age-old rumours that Mariah’s label were involved in paying off radio stations for airplay. Chaka was particularly exasperated to learn of Adele’s position at number 22, stating: ‘OK, I quit.’ But it was Family Affair hitmaker Mary coming in at 25 – four places ahead of Chaka – that really riled up the legend. ‘These are blind bat b*****s!’ she fumed to Los Angeles Magazine, adding: ‘These b*****s are blind as a m***********g bat! They need hearing aids, they don’t have eyes, they don’t have ears… These must be the children of Helen Keller!’ The Ain’t Nobody hitmaker also wasn’t thrilled to hear Tina Turner had been put at a pretty low 55, declaring it ‘crazy’ and ‘insane’, while she said of Joan Baez being ranked at 189: ‘Let’s be honest, the b***h cannot sing. Now, she was a good writer.’ Fans have been howling at Chaka’s brutal honesty, and it’s safe to say, the internet has had a meltdown over the battle of the divas. ‘I hope i have this much self confidence when i grow up….hopefully i’ll be right tho,’ one tweeted about Chaka’s scathing comments. Another stated: ‘She’s right. She’s a powerhouse. She should be higher on the list.’ ‘Imagine putting her at #29 when the girlies nowadays could never,’ one fan declared. One fan laughed: ‘Chaka Khan has me SCREAMING I think I love her a little more now. The Mary drag SENT ME!’ It comes after fans were absolutely outraged that My Heart Will Go On singer Celine had been entirely snubbed from the list, with dozens of them even picketing outside Rolling Stone offices in New York in January. Metro.co.uk has reached out to reps for Adele, Mariah Carey and Mary J Blige for comment. Got a story?
