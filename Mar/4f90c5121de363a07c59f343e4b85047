If you’ve ventured to Home Bargains recently, you may have noticed certain symbols on the price labels. Red star stickers make an appearance on some price tags in stores, and if you’re curious about what they mean, one man has done the hard work for you. A customer turned to Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK group on Facebook for the answers. ‘Just a quick question, does anybody know what these red star stickers are for?’ Jake wrote. ‘I was thinking special offer or managers special but the items I have seen them on haven’t changed in price.’ The answer quickly came in from those who work at the store. One employee replied: ‘It’s a product we will always stock. ‘It’s mainly for staff so if we don’t have any in to leave the price there and leave the shelf space as it should come back in on the next delivery if we sell out.’ Another added that it represents the top 75 best sellers in the company. Expanding on this, someone else chipped in: ‘It’s the 75 products that they think people buy the most.’ Another employee explains that the star stickers are so that staff know they will always need the space for that product – as it shouldn’t stay empty for more than a day. It seems lots of stores have a similar system on products – a few years ago it was revealed what the various symbols mean in Zara. It turns out they represent the different collections – so a circle is for woman, a square is basic, and a triangle marks TRF. Do you have a story to share?
