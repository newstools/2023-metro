Dog walkers have been warned after a deadly plant was discovered on a beach in Cornwall. Suzanne Dellamuro discovered roots from the toxic plant hemlock while walking her pet dog on Carbis Bay Beach on Sunday morning. She posted a photo of the plant on Facebook and issued a stark warning. She said: ‘Beware, hemlock roots found on Carbis bay beach. I picked it up with gloves and disposed of it. But be careful it’s very, very poisonous.’ The plant roots look like a mixture of bananas, turnips and beans, and can be fatal to dogs (and humans) if ingested. They are even more toxic than the leaves of the plant, to the extent that one single root could kill a cow if swallowed. Even touching the plant can result in a painful rash – and contact with the eyes can produce a burning effect. This plant prefers damp places and can grow in huge colonies on waste ground, riverbanks, and ditches, but can also be seen along roadside verges. Hemlock attacks the nervous and respiratory systems once consumed, and can cause respiratory failure as the body is poisoned. Other symptoms include rapid heart loss, weakness and muscle pain, speech loss, convulsions and lack of consciousness. Because of these consequences, it is vital to contact the emergency services immediately, if you or your pet come into contact with the plant.
