A mum accidentally used spray paint to clean the inside of her car, turning it a vibrant shade of white. Her daughters, Greta and Jayde, from Australia, filmed the hysterical moment they saw the freshly painted Mazda for the first time. It turns out their mum mistook a can of Motospray’s ‘New Look Vinyl Spray’ for normal vinyl cleaner – with hilarious consequences. Her clean-up job looked more like a vandal had gone to town, covering the doors, dashboard and steering wheel with random white streaks. ‘Oh my god, what has she done?’ Greta says in the video. ‘She has totally f****d her whole car!’ She then posted the video on TikTok with the sarcastic caption: ‘When mum thinks spray paint is vinyl cleaner… she got every nook and cranny!’ Some people came to her mum’s defence, saying the label on the can was a bit misleading. Jenni wrote: ‘Hands up everyone who still thinks that looks like vinyl cleaner.’ ‘I don’t understand that label! That appears to be vinyl cleaner to me too,’ Jae Rylee wrote. Jason added: ‘I in no way blame your mum. That label is insane.’ Drivers in the UK have also had some bad luck of late, including an entrepreneur who parked his £100,000 supercar in Leeds city centre overnight. Waseem Khan returned from his trip to Manchester to find his three-month-old Audi R8 V10 vandalised and covered in graffiti. Don’t feel too sorry for the 20-year-old, though, as he boasts he can make £6,000 ‘while he sleeps’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
