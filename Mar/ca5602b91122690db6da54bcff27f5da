Demand for grow-your-own vegetable seeds has rocketed amid a shortage of fresh produce at supermarkets. Sales at Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) outlets soared 20 per cent last month, while Mr Fothergill’s Seeds saw a 50 per cent leap in online purchases. It comes after major supermarkets limited the number of vegetables – such as tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers – customers can buy amid shortages. Recent bad weather in Spain and North Africa, along with complex supply chains and Brexit, have been blamed for empty supermarket shelves. Ex-environment minister George Eustice claimed the shortages would last up to four weeks but some growers said supply issues could continue until May. Fed-up customers are now preparing to grow their own fresh produce, said Mike Burks, of the Gardens Group. ‘Over the last couple of weeks, sales  of seeds have rocketed,’ he told the BBC. ‘Potatoes, peas, beans, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. It’s across the board’ Sales of compost, seed trays, pots and propagators have also shown double digit growth, he added. And many people plan to grow veg on patios and in window boxes, he said. Tim Upson, of the RHS, said there had been a ‘big trend’ of people growing their own food since the start of the pandemic. ‘This is likely to increase as a reaction to the fruit and veg shortages, as well as people looking for ways to save money to keep up with living costs,’ he added.
