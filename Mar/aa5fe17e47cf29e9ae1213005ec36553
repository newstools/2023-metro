A 17-year-old boy has been left with slashes around his eye after being stabbed at a house party, his mum said. The unnamed teenager was hurt while at a friend’s house in Smallthorne, Stoke-on-Trent, when he was attacked on Saturday night. Horrific photos show the boy’s face with a deep, bloody cut above his eye with a lighter cut on the side of his eye. Paramedics were called at around 11.30pm and he was rushed to Royal Stoke University Hospital with ‘potentially serious injuries’. The boy is now out of hospital and his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing. However, his assailants are still at large and no one has been arrested for the attack yet. His mum, and several of his other family members, have asked why the police are yet to make any arrests. She said: ‘It’s any parent’s worst nightmare to get a phone call saying your child’s been stabbed. It was from one of my son’s friends. ‘He has got slashes to his face, quite a big slash to his head above his eye, and then right the way down his cheek. ‘He’s been having headaches, because it’s right above his eye, he won’t even leave the house now. ‘I’ve been so worried, I’ve not been letting him out even though he doesn’t want to go out. I’ve had to call in work because I’ve not even been sleeping. ‘It’s not just me, I can’t even get one of his younger brothers to eat because he’s just worried. I only stopped shaking a couple of days after it happened. ‘A few people in the family aren’t impressed that there’ve been no arrests yet. He’s had all the time to get rid of any evidence, clothes and stuff like that.’ Police are currently investigating and have asked any witnesses to come forward with information.
