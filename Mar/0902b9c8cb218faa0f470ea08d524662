Willian has been ruled out of Fulham’s Premier League clash with Arsenal on Sunday. The 34-year-old, who spent one season at Arsenal, has been in sublime form since joining Fulham on a free transfer last September. But the winger will miss the game against his former club after he suffered a back injury during Saturday’s training session. Speaking ahead of the game, Willian admitted that he regretted swapping Chelsea for Arsenal in 2020. ‘Yeah I wish I’d never left,’ he told Sky Sports. ‘Of course it’s easy now to say something but when you stop to think about all the situations I say to myself ‘I wish I never left’. ‘But it’s life, I’m happy now at Fulham and I’m enjoying myself there. ‘They [Arsenal] are flying now. I think it was in the middle when things were changing a lot. I was excited when I signed with them, I was training hard but it just didn’t work and that’s it.’ Meanwhile, Arsenal could see Gabriel Jesus make his first appearance since he suffered a knee injury at the World Cup.  The Brazil international, who hasn’t featured for Arsenal since November, has been named on the bench for the first time since he underwent surgery in December. Asked what it meant to have Jesus back in his Arsenal squad, Mikel Arteta said before the game: ‘Huge. ‘His presence, what he transmits to the teams, the experience he has in these types of games, he’s a huge player for us. ‘He’s changed our dynamic, he’s changed our belief he’s put the team in a different status and it’s great to have him back.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
