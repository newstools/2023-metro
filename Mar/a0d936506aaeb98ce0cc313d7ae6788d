Rail engineering workers and whiskey factory staff are all walking out today in yet another day of strike disruption. Last month saw upwards of 500,000 people across public and private sectors taking to the picket line. Since January, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers, rail workers, taxi drivers, civil servants, barristers and bus drivers have all started industrial action. Engineering workers at Balfour Beatty will take three 36 hour strikes next month in a pay dispute. RMT General Secretary Mick Lynch said: ‘These highly skilled workers have had enough of not been offered a decent wage rise. ‘The cost-of-living crisis has affected all workers and our members are not prepared to pay the price while the company enjoy huge revenues. ‘Balfour Beatty is a highly profitable company and they need to use some of their excess wealth to reward their workers properly.’ Workers at drinks giant Diageo are also walking out over money after the company lowered the rate of pay for new-starters without consulting unions. Unite estimates some of its members could lose 6% of their pay. Diageo has previously said the action only involves 10 people. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
