Radio DJ Declan Pierce has revealed he was rushed to hospital earlier this week after suffering a brain haemorrhage. The 40-year-old, who presents Today FM, shared that he spent eight days in hospital receiving treatment. He wrote: ‘On Tuesday I got home after 8 day in hospital following a brain haemorrhage. ‘I’m making an incredible full recovery. I’m bless beyond words. ‘Massive love to my wife, my family, friends and colleagues at Today FM for unending support.’ He also thanked the team at Beaumont Hospital and the paramedics at Dublin Fire Brigade for all their help. Alongside the words, he shared a touching image hugging his young daughter, captioned: ‘Life is good. I’m feeling blessed. Getting stronger by the hour’. Earlier this week, Declan had been showered in support by fans when he shared an update on Twitter: ‘I won’t be around this weekend on @TodayFM but the show goes on and it’s loaded with massive tunes! ‘I’ll be offline for a few days for personal reasons and because we always chat on here I wanted to let u know. Sending love and positivity. Chat soon’. ‘Hi Dec, speaking also as a survivor of a brain haemorrhage, you’re not alone and there is light at the end of recovery. Stay strong, wish you well,’ one person wrote. Another penned: ‘Sorry to hear that, glad to hear you’re on the mend and that you’re back home with your family. Mind yourself.’ Got a story?
