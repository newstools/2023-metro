A hostage situation is underway in Germany with roads locked down by police. Armed officers have been mobilised to a pharmacy building in the city of Karlsruhe. They did not say how many hostages there were or how long the operation had been going on. Police armed with guns can be seen outside the building with police tape cordoning the street off. The danger level is ‘unclear’, the force said on Twitter. Two people are believed to be held hostage with a ‘ransom’ requested. Reached by the Reuters news agency by phone, a spokesperson did not say how many hostages there were or how long the operation had been going on. The alarm was raised around 4.30pm today. The possible hostage situation follows Thursday’s deadly rampage at a Jehovah’s Witnesses hall in Hamburg. It left eight people dead, including the attacker. The victims were four men, two women and an unborn baby still in its mother’s womb. Police rushed to the scene at 9pm amid unconfirmed reports of shooters on the run. The Hamburg city government said the shooting took place in the Gross Borstel district. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
