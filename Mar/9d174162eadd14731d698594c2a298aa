This is the shocking moment two speeding Ferraris crashed into a house at the same time. CCTV footage shows them sailing through the air outside the villa near the town of Osimo in eastern Italy. The supercars land feet apart after hitting the fence with such a force that debris was sent flying into the swimming pool. Both drivers, reportedly from Belgium and Holland, are believed to have misjudged a bend at high speed in what may have been a race. One driver was filmed emerging from the red vehicle apparently unharmed. The second is seen staggering toward a passer-by before falling to the ground, while his blue Ferrari catching fire not long after. Local media reported that emergency services attended the scene and an air ambulance was sent to retrieve the two men. They were taken to a hospital in Ancona, but they sustained only minor injuries. Police are understood to be investigating the incident. The collision happened just one day before another crash involving a Ferrari in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, which sadly proved fatal. A 30-year-old man was killed when his Â£250,000 supercar left the road, struck a tree and flipped over on Sunday. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
