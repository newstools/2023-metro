A murder suspect who was unshackled during his trial – as mandated by state law – made a run for it. Edi Villalobos, 28, was escorted by two sheriff’s deputies into the Washington County Courthouse for his trial for allegedly killing a relative and stabbing an unrelated man. Surveillance footage shows one of the deputies removing Villalobos’ wrist restraints. The defendant then sits down on a chair at the side of a table and the deputy unshackles his ankle restraints. Villalobos, wearing black slacks and a blue dress shirt, walks over to a chair at the middle of the table where he is expected to sit, places a hand over it, then dashes out of the courtroom. ‘When it comes to removing the restraints, that’s what Oregon law requires us to do,’ a Washington County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told KATU. Both deputies ran after Villalobos, with one trailing the other, but the defendant outran them out the door of the courtroom. Surveillance footage from other cameras throughout the courthouse document Villalobos’ escape. In the hallway, he got farther ahead of the deputies. Villalobos hopped in front of a woman and almost tackled a man as he ran through a staff only door. A manhunt ensued for Villalobos, that included using drones. It wasn’t until about two hours later when someone reported a person trying to break into an apartment on the 300 block of Southeast 4th Avenue, that deputies captured Villalobos.
