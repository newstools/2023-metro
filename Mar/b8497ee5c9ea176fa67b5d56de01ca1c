Let’s be honest, we all make a judgement when we take the car to other parts of the UK for work or a holiday – how do the drivers here compare to the ones back home? Your view might be tainted by your personal experience in a particular city, or how you feel about certain brands, or how busy you like your roads. But here is a decent attempt at an index that might provide an objective, definitive list of the British cities with the best and worst drivers. It takes into account data from local driving tests as well as fatal, serious and slight traffic crashes, feeding everything into a big algorithm to pump out a ranking. A spokesman for data collators One Sure Insurance told MailOnline: ‘On average someone is injured or killed on roads in the UK every 16 minutes. ‘The majority of these accidents are caused by speeding. Bad driving can lead to preventable accidents, death and damage that could cost you.’ Here’s where you’d find the nation’s top and bottom-ranked drivers, according to their figures.
