A mother and her three-year-old son who were killed when a lorry crashed into their car, which had stopped on a lane of traffic, have been named by police. It is believed that the blue Ford Focus in which Nicola Courtney, 34, had been driving her son Lucas Page, had broken down just after 9pm on Friday. A white articulated lorry travelling west on the A180 near Immingham, Lincolnshire, collided with the car. Nicola and Lucas, from Scunthorpe, sustained fatal injuries, and both were pronounced dead at the scene. Officers said formal identification of the mum and son is yet to take place. Their families have been informed and are currently being supported by specialist trained officers. Police said in a statement: ‘The full circumstances of the collision will be established during this complex investigation, and we would ask for people not to speculate about the circumstances of the crash. ‘A voluntary IOPC referral has been made after we received calls about the broken down vehicle prior to the collision occurring.’ Police are appealing for witnesses.
