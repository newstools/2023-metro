Loving mum Victoria Beckham’s heart was clearly fit to burst following a family reunion in Paris over the weekend to celebrate eldest son Brooklyn’s 24th birthday. The extended Beckham clan, including both Victoria and retired footballer David’s sets of parents, Brooklyn’s wife Nicola Peltz, 28, and his siblings Cruz, 18, and Harper, 11, came together in the French capital to mark Brooklyn’s special day. Sadly, middle son Romeo, 20, was unable to attend, with the former Spice Girl sharing that he was ‘missed’ on social media. Brooklyn’s birthday coincided with Victoria’s Paris Fashion Week show, so the family was also out in full force to support the 48-year-old as she showcased her latest designs on the runway. The former Spice Girl founded her eponymous fashion label in 2008. Following her successful showing, the family got down to important birthday business with Brooklyn on Saturday, with Victoria sharing a peek into their celebrations together as she posted a sweet tribute to her eldest following his big day. Taking to Instagram on Sunday, the proud mum shared an adorable set of photos of Brooklyn giving a big cuddle to his little sister Harper, with one showing her hiding her face from the camera with her hand. ‘Your little sister loves you more than you could ever know and being together on your birthday made us all so happy,’ Victoria wrote in the caption. ‘We love you so much @brooklynpeltzbeckham #harperseven 💕@davidbeckham’ She had also shared a sweet photo of both her and David hugging a seated Brooklyn, as well as pictures of Brooklyn and Nicola with her parents, Jackie and Anthony Adams, who have been married since 1970. ‘Being together is everything!!’ the former chart-topper captioned one picture. David’s mum Sandra, as well as his dad Ted and his new wife Hilary were also all there and beaming happily in photos by their grandchildren. ‘Ted’s first time in Paris and defiantly [sic] his first fashion show!!!’ wrote Victoria under one snap of Ted, Hilary, Brooklyn and Nicola. Nicola was seen firmly nestled in the Beckham family’s bosom this weekend, squashing allegations that she and Victoria are locked in a family ‘feud’. Rumours circulated last year that Nicola and her mother-in-law fell out over the planning of the Bates Motel actress and wannabe chef Brooklyn’s multi-million-dollar wedding in Florida last April. Nicola was accused of snubbing an offer to wear one of Victoria’s designs as her wedding dress, but the model and actress has shut down the rumours. ‘It’s not a feud! I keep seeing everywhere that word, “feud, feud, feud!”’ Nicola said. ‘I don’t know why they say “feud”? I mean, maybe they picked up on something? And now they’re labelling it feud?’ she told the Sunday Times. As part of Victoria’s slew of pictures from after her fashion show, she reshared posts from both Brooklyn and Nicola showing the couple at her show, with Nicola looking chic decked out in – what else? – a grey and silver Victoria Beckham dress paired with long black patent gloves. Under both she added her own avatar emoji, blowing a kiss. She also posted a video clip of the whole family serenading Brooklyn with ‘happy birthday’ as he was presented with a cake complete with massive sparkler, joking: ‘We can hear where I get my singing talent from.’ Got a story?
