A brave bus driver hopped out of his vehicle and casually removed an enormous snake from a busy road using just his hands. Video footage of the dramatic rescue, taken on the Gold Coast in Australia, went viral this week. It shows a bus stationary in the middle of traffic as its uniformed driver walks over to the snake and picks it up by the tail. He then rushes to the side of the road with his arm outstretched and the snake dangling precariously from his hand. The creature attempts to strike the man a couple of times but the driver simply nonchalantly moves out of the way. After reaching a grassy patch near some shops he places the snake on the ground and heads back to his bus. The rescue in Tugun, Queensland, was caught on camera by an onlooker sitting in in the traffic and later published on Mail Online. Social media users called the bus driver’s actions ‘typical’ of a Queenslander. ‘Tell me you live Queensland without telling me you live in Queensland,’ one joked. Other people commenting online praised the man’s brave actions. One wrote: ‘What a hero. I love anyone who saves wildlife.’ While another said: ‘Top man! Well impressed!!’ And a third posted: ‘Not all heroes wear capes, some wear stubby shorts.’ All snakes in Australia are protected under the Nature Conservation Act of 2014, making it illegal to kill them. The law is waved, however, if the snake is threatening human life. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
