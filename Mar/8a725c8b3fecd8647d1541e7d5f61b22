Millions can finally breathe a sigh of relief as all industrial action on Network Rail has been suspended. Strikes were set to begin on March 16 after the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) rejected offers from train operators. The RMT national executive committee confirmed it has received a new offer from the employer. As a result, all walkouts on Network Rail have been called off until further notice. The RMT said more updates would be given in the coming days. In an update on Twitter, the union added that there will be a referendum of staff for Network Rail. Currently, there is no change in the planned action against the 14 train operators represented by the Rail Delivery Group on 16, 18, 30 March and 1 April. Members of the RMT have been taking part in walkouts for months over a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. In February, general secretary Mick Lynch said the union will take ‘sustained and targeted industrial action over the next few months’ as employers are ‘not being given a fresh mandate by the Government’ to offer a new deal. The 24-hour strike planned by Network Rail workers would have coincided with the ones by teachers in England and Wales, as well as action by university staff. Got a story?
