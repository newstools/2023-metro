Colin Farrell seized the opportunity to call out Saturday Night Live during an awkward interaction with host Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscars 2023. It all kicked off when the Irish star, who is nominated for the best actor gong at the 95th Academy Awards for his role in Banshees of Inishirin, was approached by the comedian and asked a ‘fan question’. During the interaction, Kimmel said the fan wanted to know what Farrell was saying during the nominated comedy-drama. In his reply, Farrell referred to last night’s controversial episode of SNL, which saw the hosts imitate Irish actors as part of a skit. ‘I’d like him to go on YouTube and check out the SNL skit from last night,’ he said. Viewers were quick to applaud Farrell for his speedy comeback on social media, with one writing: ‘Colin Farrell being asked a lazy stupid question about banshees and answering it by dissing SNL ??? Literally no choice but to love this man.’ Echoing a similar sentiment, another tweeted: ‘Fair play Colin Farrell for calling Kimmel out by referencing that appalling SNL skit last night.’ A third added: ‘OMG!!!! #ColinFarrell I-love-you!!!! What a comeback answer🙏 How do you like them apples?!’ In the controversial SNL sketch, presenters Mario Lopez and Maria Menounos mock-interviewed celebrities as they pretended they were presenters on the red carpet. One of the hosts said: ‘I’m told that we have the stars of The Banshees of Inisherin, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.’ Seconds later, Mikey Day and Molly Kearny appeared as Farrell and Banshees co-star Gleeson. ‘How do you guys like your chances tonight?’ the actors were asked, with comedians then replying in extremely put-on, hard-to-understand accents. Lopez and Menounos then joked: ‘Wow, and they haven’t even started drinking yet!’ Got a story?
