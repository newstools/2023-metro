Lady Gaga jumped straight into action to help a photographer on the red carpet at the Oscars, without missing a single step. The Bloody Mary singer has been nominated for best song at the ceremony, for her efforts on the Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack. The 36-year-old proudly waved for waiting fans as she made her way into the Dolby Theatre, in LA, ahead of her performance of Hold My Hand. She slayed in a sheer, long-sleeved black dress, complete with bejeweled detailing – fresh from the Versace catwalk. However, the brief journey into the venue wasn’t without drama as she noticed a photographer fall – and quickly swooped to their rescue. In a video captured by People Magazine, she rushed over to make sure that the photographer was unharmed. Once reassured that he was back up on his feet, Gaga – real name Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta – continued on into the ceremony. A true queen. Fans were truly living for the brief moment, and heaped praise on the musician in the comments below. ‘Seen so many instances of her being this way….and it’s always instant, without any forethought or calculation,’ one said. ‘💯 who she is!’ ‘She’s amazing. We need more people like this,’ another agreed. ‘And that ladies and gents is why we love her,’ a follower penned. An Instagram user wrote: ‘She is always a class act.’ As a commenter added: ‘She looks gorgeous and how wonderful she was willing to lend a “helping hand”.’ Later in the night, Gaga appeared on stage to perform a stunning rendition of Hold My Hand – after she was rumored to be missing her big night. The track earned a nomination for best song, which has been mentioned in the category alongside Rihanna’s Lift Me Up, from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Tracks Applause from Tell It Like a Woman, Naatu Naatu from RRR and This is a Life from Everything Everywhere All at Once were also recognized. Got a story?
