In her final horoscope, Mystic Meg predicted she’d ‘take a journey towards her soulmate’, an eerie reading considering Nigel Moores, the man considered to be ‘the love of her life’, died more than 40 years ago. It was announced on Wednesday that the Sun columnist had died at the age of 80, shortly after being admitted to hospital with flu. Her agent of 34 years, Dave Shapland, confirmed the sad news, hailing her ‘Britain’s most famous astrologer by a million miles’. ‘Nobody came close to Meg in that respect. She was followed by millions in this country and also around the world,’ he said. Since confirmation of Meg’s death broke, her final horoscope has been published. Writing in the Sun, Mystic Meg, whose real name was Margaret Anne Lake, predicted those whose star sign was Leo would soon ‘take a journey towards her soulmate’. Meg was herself a Leo, according to MailOnline, and the paper also said that Nigel was the love of Mystic Meg’s life. Meg’s final horoscope read in full: ‘It can be the most routine of routine journeys that takes you towards your soulmate – and you may not realise this straight away. ‘The emotional warmth of your chart is a wonderful thing to savour, so don’t rush. If you’re in love, partners can learn from each other, this shouldn’t be a one-sided process.’ Nigel, who was the heir to Littlewoods, died in a car crash in 1977 while in the south of France. Before she started writing horoscopes, Meg started her career delivering psychic readings over the phone in the early eighties. But it was when she fronted The National Lottery that she hit the big time, as she was roped in to predict facts about the future winner. She delivered winning predictions each week from 1994 until 2000, and it didn’t take bosses long to realise she had something special.
