Jamie Carragher is not letting the monumental result from Sunday go just yet, trolling Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel live on television. Liverpool hammered United 7-0 in a stunning Premier League result at Anfield, and unsurprisingly the Reds hero is still revelling in it. Both he and Schmeichel were on punditry duty for the Champions League night on Tuesday, with Chelsea hosting Borussia Dortmund, and Carragher was given the chance to ask the legendary goalkeeper some questions. The former England defender had already placed a can of 7 Up on his desk in front of him, before asking a string of questions which featured the number seven. ‘Peter I just wanted to ask you, we’re getting to that stage with the Champions League, into March now, the 7th of March! For me it feels really important, into March, the 7th! How important does it feel being at the Bridge?’ Carragher asked on CBS Sports. Schmeichel quickly saw what was going on in the studio and joked from Stamford Bridge: ‘I’m sure that was a great question, but Jamie we can’t hear you. We can see that you’re talking, we just can’t hear you.’ Carragher was unrelenting, though, asking: ‘Jude Bellingham, he’s a superstar, we feel like he’s going to move on in the summer. What type of price tag are we talking? You’d think it would have to start with a seven and go from there.’ He pushed further, asking: ‘You’re going to be at AC Milan tomorrow, that’s another huge game, we’re talking about the seven-time winners! Seven times they’ve won the Champions League!’ It is a result that is not going to be forgotten by Liverpool or Manchester United fans any time soon.
