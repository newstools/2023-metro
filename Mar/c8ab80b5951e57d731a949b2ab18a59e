Looking at the cold and miserable weather outside, it’s only natural to want to wrap yourself up in your bedding and take it with you when you venture out. But you needn’t bother now, as one of the biggest fashion trends this spring is quilted clothes – so you can stay wrapped up and cosy, without dirtying your duvet or throw. Puffy, quilted clothes and accessories are everywhere right now, from jackets to bags. While the humble puffer jacket may have been our saviour during the depths of winter, as we head into spring the quilted variety offers a more lightweight alternative – for the perfect transitional piece. Wear them done-up or undone, depending on what the weather throws at you. But there’s no reason that functional needs to be boring. In fact, quilted garments this season are bold and bright, with eye-catching colours and patterns – whether it’s a patchwork coat or a vibrant bag. We’ve rounded up some of our favourites on the high street right now. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
