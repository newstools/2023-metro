Disgraced Prince Andrew is considering giving a new tell-all television interview to win back public support. The Duke previously took part in a sit-down chat with Emily Maitlis on BBC’s Panorama. Doing so presented more questions than answers, with the royal facing online ridicule after claiming he could not sweat. The Mirror has now claimed Andrew has been approached by two major US broadcasters with an offer for an exclusive interview in the UK. It echoes the approach Harry and Meghan took in using US media to share details of what their life was like within the royal family. Friends of Prince Andrew claim he hopes to do the same and give an in-depth look into recent years. A source close to the Duke told The Mirror: ‘Nothing is off the table. Andrew has been made to give up his job and now potentially his home. ‘He feels there is little else to lose when he has already paid an awfully high price.’ Meanwhile, Andrew is reportedly furious with Charles for not letting him wear ceremonial robes for the King’s coronation in May. A royal source said: ‘To say relations between the two brothers is a little fraught at present would be a huge understatement.’ Charles is also reportedly toying with the idea of evicting Andrew from his 30-room Windsor mansion Royal Lodge. He has instead been offered Harry and Meghan’s five-bedroom Frogmore Cottage. Andrew has not stepped foot in the US ever since the FBI announced they wanted to speak to him as a witness as part of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The Duke now has a limited role within the royal family after being forced to stand down from royal duties and stripped of his military and charitable appointments. He was forced to pay Virginia £12million last year in an out of court settlement, despite protesting his innocence. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
