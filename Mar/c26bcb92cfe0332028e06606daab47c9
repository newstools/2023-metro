A man who lives his life completely barefoot claims he was barred from a McDonald’s branch for not wearing shoes. James Graham, from Bexhill, East Sussex, was asked to leave the fast-food restaurant shortly after he sat down at a table. When he questioned a member of staff about why he was asked to leave, he said she replied: ‘No shoes, no shirt, no service’. James described the incident, which happened on February 23, was a bit silly and added he was sitting next to a play area which is often full of bare-footed children. He said: ‘I spoke to head office and emailed them. ‘They said it was down to the franchise manager of that site. I think it’s strange to make these decisions in a split second when I’m doing no harm to anyone. ‘In 2013 I had a life-changing experience. My wife passed and since then I have just been living life. ‘Life is too short to not do things you think you might want to do.’ Since the tragic event, James has focused on running 20 marathons barefoot and recently completed the Eastbourne Half Marathon. James admitted his barefoot lifestyle generates a mix of responses from other people. The barefoot man said: ‘Some are completely horrified and don’t understand it. Other people fully support it and say they wish they had the courage and freedom to do it.’ A spokesperson for McDonald’s explained how the safety of James had been a key priority for staff. They said: ‘At McDonald’s we want to create a welcoming environment for all our customers to enjoy their experience. ‘The Bexhill team informed the customer that for his own safety and for the comfort of other diners all customers are asked to wear footwear in the restaurant. ‘When he refused, the customer was allowed to remain on this occasion and finish his food before leaving.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
