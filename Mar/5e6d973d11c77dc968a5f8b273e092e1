Spencer Matthews has thanked fans for their patience after his documentary Finding Michael finally arrived on Disney Plus after delays. On Friday, audiences were confused when the film, which follows Spencer on the hunt for his brother’s body on Mount Everest, still wasn’t on the streaming service. Addressing fans’ concern, the former Made in Chelsea star explained: ‘Apologies to everyone trying to view Finding Michael on Disney+. ‘The debut date has shifted and we’ll update you as soon as we have the new timings.’ It might be five days late but Spencer finally confirmed Finding Michael is available to stream now. ‘Delighted to let you now that Finding Michael is now streaming on Disney+ in the UK and Ireland with the rest of the world coming very soon,’ he wrote. ‘Thank you so much for your patience and overwhelming support. ‘Really proud to be sharing Michael’s story with you all.’ In 1999, aged 22, Michael Matthews became the youngest ever Brit to reach the summit of Mount Everest. However, three hours later, he vanished but his body was never recovered. Three years ago, Spencer and his family received a photo from another climber speculating that a body they came across could be Michael’s. Finding Michael is the extraordinary account of Spencer travelling to Nepal and joining a team of climbers to try and retrieve that body. Finding Michael is available to stream on Disney Plus now.
