Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has warned Manchester United that his side will give them a ‘big fight’ on Sunday. The Reds defeated Wolves 2-0 on Wednesday night thanks to goals from Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah. That result sees them move up to sixth in the Premier League table but they are still 10 points behind Erik ten Hag’s team ahead of Sunday’s clash at Anfield. United, who won the Carabao Cup on Sunday and are still able to achieve a quadruple this term, are looking to do the double over their rivals having beaten Liverpool 2-1 at Old Trafford in August. But Klopp has fired a warning to United as told Premier League Productions: ‘It’s a big game against a team in form. ‘We have to be ready, and we will give them a big fight.’ Speaking more generally about Liverpool’s win over Wolves, Klopp added: ‘We controlled the game without creating massively, but we found our rhythm back. ‘The second half, we started a bit hectic, then we scored a wonderful goal which is disallowed. ‘Very often when that happens it stays 0-0 or we lose with a late goal, but the boys really wanted it. ‘You have to break an opponent down step by step, it’s not often they make mistakes and you get easy goals in the 420 or something games I’ve had here.’ Klopp then told the BBC: ‘We knew it would be a difficult game, we controlled the game in a lot of periods. “In general we did defensively well tonight, Diogo in the 10 was really important, the midfield was together, defensively we had a high line and won decisive challenges. Ali [Alisson] didn’t have spectacular saves to make which was good. ‘We had a knock against Real Madrid, we played a really good first half then we started the second really bad. We looked a lot more stable today, we have to carry that on.’ MORE : Sadio Mane reveals what Cristiano Ronaldo told him after leaving Liverpool MORE : Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool are still capable of gatecrashing top four
