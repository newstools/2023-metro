A hero bus driver saved a lost sheep from a busy road – by using her handbag strap as a lasso. Martine Patey was driving a Rail Replacement bus along the A27 near Eastbourne, East Sussex on Sunday, February 26 when she noticed a coach stopped with its hazards on. She then saw a ‘flash of white’ dart out from behind the vehicle into the major road – which runs between Pevensey in East Sussex and Whiteparish in Hampshire – causing havoc among passing cars. Martine quickly realised the source of the mayhem was a lost sheep. Rather than continue on, she decided to pull over and donned her high-vis jacket as she began her attempts to rescue the scared creature. At first, she tried to coax the farm animal out of the road. It evaded capture until Martine came up with a novel way to reach the woolly wanderer. She said: ‘The sheep was running all over the road. It was difficult to catch, but then it slipped just in front of me and I was able to get hold of it and to use my handbag strap like a lasso. ‘Two other motorists had stopped to help and together we were able to hold onto it until the police arrived.’ Police asked Martine to drive the lost animal back to a local farm so she led it into the downstairs aisle of her double-decker bus. Before setting off, she seized the opportunity to snap a selfie with her unlikely passenger. The sheep can be seen looking quite relaxed among other passengers in the background of the photo. It enjoyed a brief ride on the bus before the farmer arrived at the scene and loaded the lost animal onto his truck to transport it the rest of the way back to the farm. After helping the sheep home, Martine resumed her journey to Eastbourne where, astonishingly, she arrived just a minute late. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
