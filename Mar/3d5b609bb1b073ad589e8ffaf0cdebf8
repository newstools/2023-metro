In a suspected arson incident in December, a homeless man’s tent was set alight just days after a gang chased him down the street. The man, known as Anthony, was thought to be sleeping in it when it was torched, destroying all of his possessions. He was planning to move away from Cleethorpes promenade, in Lincolnshire, fearing something like that may happen. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
