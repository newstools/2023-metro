Have you ever wanted to sleep within arm’s reach of your kitchen? Well, if you’ve got a spare £1,820 coming in each month, this could be the flat for you. Located in London, of course, this Fitzrovia property comes fully furnished with a wardrobe, bookcase, TV, an extension of the kitchen counter to eat off, and a teeny tiny coffee table. There’s also a compact separate bathroom, and the kitchen features an oven and sink. Did somebody say breakfast in bed? Bills are included in the price of rent, and the landlord has included Sky TV Channels and WiFi too, you lucky thing! The listing, which has been posted on OpenRent, reads: ‘New, modern studio apartment refurbished to a very high standard. ‘Located in a well maintained recently refurbished period property, overlooking an attractive garden square. Self-contained. ‘Open plan fitted kitchen with oven, cooker, fridge, freezer and microwave. En-suite tiled shower/wc with heated towel rail. ‘Neutral decor, fully furnished, wood floors. Free fast fibre optic WiFi broadband internet. ‘Free digital TV/selected Sky channels. Free shared laundry and ironing facilities. ‘Use of shared landscaped back gardens. The rent includes electricity, water and heating.’ Although the price for a pad this size may make you wince, it still comes in cheaper than the average rent in London in 2023, which has hit a record high of £2,480 per month. Outside the capital, monthly rates also recently surpassed £1,100 for the first time, so flocking to the countryside may not cut it – especially if you still need to pay to commute into work. Sigh.
