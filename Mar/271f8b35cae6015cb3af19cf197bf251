A promising racehorse and a rescued corgi have forged a special friendship worthy of a Disney film. Champion trainer Paul Nicholls is behind the thoroughbred named Thank You Ma’am. The horse was named in honour of the late Queen. Thank You Ma’am recently took a quick break from training to meet Paul’s pet dog named Sam. The four-year-old gelding hit it off during the playdate despite their vastly different statures. Sam is a corgi – just like the late monarch’s much-loved dogs Muick and Sandy – so the special connection was not lost on Paul. He now hopes to organise more meets between the horse and dog friend at his Berkshire home. Paul, who won the 2012 Grand National, hopes to reach the podium again with another racehorse, Bravemansgame. He said about Thank You Ma’am: ‘He’s got a cracking pedigree, so looks the part on paper and I hope we can have plenty of fun with him. ‘I’m looking forward to Cheltenham and to Bravemansgame’s outing, and, you never know, in a couple of years Thank You Ma’am could be at Cheltenham.’ Racegoers will be gearing up for the Cheltenham Festival, the highlight of the jump season, which begins later this month and in recent years has been attended by the Queen Consort, a passionate racegoer. There has been speculation in the racing world the King will take up his mother’s interest in the sport and also become a leading figure at Royal Ascot. Thank You Ma’am is destined to compete over jumps but his introduction to the sport will be a flat race, a point-to-point meet at Bangor-on-Dee Racecourse near Wrexham on March 12.
