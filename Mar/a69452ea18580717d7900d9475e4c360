The recent shortages of tomatoes, peppers and more could give us a taste of what’s to come, according to a new report. Some everyday essentials could be at risk of becoming ‘endangered’ due to climate change. And it’s bad news if you rely on a daily coffee, banana, or even a square of dark chocolate. A new report published by the Fairtrade Foundation, has found that supply chains for bananas, coffee, and cocoa originate from countries that are vulnerable to threats caused by climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. According to Fairtrade, many cocoa-growing regions in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire (where the majority is produced) will probably be too hot to grow the crop by 2050. Likewise, 50% of the area where coffee farming takes place around the world is set to be labelled as ‘no longer suitable’ by 2050, due to the changing climate. In fact, currently more than 90% of Fairtrade Kenyan coffee farmers say they are already experiencing the effects of climate change. Bananas are also at risk of becoming ‘endangered’ with almost half of the UK’s imports coming from countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. So these everyday essentials we are so used to selecting in supermarkets could be much harder to come by. However, Mike Gidney – the CEO of the Fairtrade Foundation – explains that if farmers and workers receive the fair price that the organisation campaigns for, they can invest in more sustainable and ‘climate resilient’ ways of farming for these products. The best way to go about this is to shop for products with the Fairtrade symbol. These simple switches helps to support producers in protecting the future of our food and the planet.
