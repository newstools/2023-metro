A mum is facing jail after she killed a man in a dramatic street chase when she saw him on a stolen motorbike. Kerry Fair, 39, said she wanted to teach Thomas Maguire, 30, a lesson for stealing a Yamaha that belonged to her daughter’s boyfriend. She spotted him riding through Kingstanding, Birmingham, in May last year so did a U-turn and started chasing him. She reached speeds of up to 86mph in a 30 zone before crashing into him. Fair then fled the scene, abandoning the car and leaving Thomas mortally injured on the floor. Thomas was taken to hospital by friends where he remained in a critical condition for three weeks before succumbing to his injuries on June 9. Fair was found guilty of manslaughter yesterday at Birmingham Crown Court and will be sentenced on March 14. Detective inspector Michelle Thurgood said: ‘At the speed she was travelling, at the very least she was reckless to the fact Thomas would be injured as a result of her actions that night. ‘Had Fair applied emergency braking when she realised she was gaining rapidly on the motorbike, the collision could have been completely avoided which inevitably could have prevented Thomas from being injured. ‘Our thoughts remain with the family of Thomas and I hope today’s verdict can bring them some closure.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
