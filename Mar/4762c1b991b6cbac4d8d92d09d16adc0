‘If there’s one recipe in the world you’ve got to learn, it’s mash potato.’ That’s what chef Robbie Bell told his followers on TikTok in one of his recent videos. But the reaction his dish received was mixed, to put it politely. The chef laid out a step-by-step guide to cooking the ultimate mash and suggested adding two rather surprising ingredients: lemon and nutmeg. Yes, nutmeg. He also advocated adding a splash of olive oil, which is a little less out there, but still unconventional. The recipe seemed to divide the foodies in the comment section, with some questioning chef Robbie’s methods. One TikToker wrote: ‘Lemon in mash? What never heard of that in my life.’ While another commented: ‘Oil? And lemon? No gracias.’ But there were some more open-minded foodies who were willing to give the recipe a go. One wrote: ‘Nutmeg and lemon. Ohhhh next time.’ While another said: ‘Happiness within potato.’ Unconvinced by chef Robbie’s dish? Teen cook Morgan Hipworth previously went viral for his perfect mash TikTok recipe, which involved boiling full-fat milk. Which would you rather try? Do you have a story to share?
