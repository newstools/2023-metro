Sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but Cadbury is going to stop making a classic treat after a 10-year run. The Dairy Milk Egg ‘n’ Spoons have fallen victim to ‘changing taste buds’ and will be no more. And just over a month before Easter too, just in case it didn’t already pain us enough. ‘We’re always listening to our Cadbury fans to ensure our Easter range includes their favourites and reflects their changing taste buds,’ a spokesperson said on the matter. ‘We’ve made a few changes to reflect this and think our 2023 line-up is eggcellent, even if we do say so ourselves!’ First produced in 2013, the Egg ‘n’ Spoons consisted of four chocolate eggs filled with mousse that were nestled in a purple egg box with two spoons for scooping out the soft filling. We’re also sad to report that lots of retailers seem to have already sold out of the stock they had left, so it’s not looking likely we’ll be able to enjoy one last taste. And fans are not impressed, with many taking to social media to lament the loss of the sweet snack. Under a TikTok video on the subject with over 300,000 likes so far, one person commented: ‘OMG I’m fuming they are my favourite.’ ‘Why? They were incredible!’ wrote another, while someone else simply commented: ‘Please tell me you’re joking.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
