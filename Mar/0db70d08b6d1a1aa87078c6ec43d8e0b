Paul Pogba has been dropped from Juventus’ squad for their Europa League tie against Freiburg due to disciplinary reasons, according to reports in Italy. The World Cup winner returned to Juve on a free transfer from Manchester United last summer but suffered a knee injury, which later required surgery, during pre-season training. Pogba made his long-awaited second debut for Juve as a late substitute in their 4-2 win over Torino last Tuesday and made a brief appearance in the 1-0 defeat to Roma on Sunday. But the midfielder will be forced to miss the first leg of Juve’s Europa League last-16 tie against Freiburg on Thursday evening. According to Goal Italy, Pogba has been disciplined by Massimiliano Allegri for turning up late to a team dinner on Wednesday evening. When asked about Pogba earlier on Wednesday, Allegri said: ‘Yesterday Pogba had a good training session, today he rested, tomorrow morning we will know if he is available. ‘Today [Wednesday] he didn’t work with the team: I think he’s available, but we’ll see.’ Speaking about the prospect of facing Freiburg, Allegri added: ‘Tomorrow [Thursday] we want to lay the foundations for the second leg. ‘They are physically strong, they are fifth in Germany, they are unbeaten in Europe. We have to get back to winning ways at home.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
