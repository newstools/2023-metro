Can you give this 20-year-old cat a loving home to see out his golden years? Timmy, whose age is the equivalent of 100 human years, was put into the care of the RSPCA Burton-upon-Trent & District branch after his owner was no longer able to cope with him. The moggy would keep sitting in the road, which led to strangers being worried about his wellbeing and repeatedly taking him to the vets and animal centres nearby. Georgia Coxon, from the Burton branch, hopes a home can be found for the ‘loving boy’ very soon. She said: ‘He’s a very special boy who, as you can imagine at the age of 20, might not have long left, but certainly has enough love to give in the meantime and deserves comfort in the time he has left.’ Timmy is the oldest cat the branch has ever seen and is believed to be one of the country’s most aged moggies. But, at 20, he’s a young lad in comparison to the world’s oldest living cat, 27-year-old Flossie who lives in London. Georgia said Timmy is in good shape, considering the many years he’s seen. ‘He’s doing really well for his age, although he will be on hyperthyroid medication for the rest of his life and has a small cancer growth on his face,’ she said. ‘But this isn’t currently affecting his quality of life and isn’t in need of treatment. ‘Now in a foster home, Timmy is kept as an indoor cat and has settled in well. ‘His new owner would need to do the same and keep him indoors. ‘Please do get in touch if you could provide a loving retirement home for the lovely Timmy.’ If you think you could give Timmy the retirement home he needs, you can pop into the charity branch or call 01283 569165.
