While people on earth were treated to two nights of rare Northern Lights, an astronaut captured the lights from his decidedly superior view in space. Nasa astronaut Josh Cassada gave us a glimpse of the dazzling lights, known as Aurora Borealis, from an angle you usually don’t get to see. Cassada snapped the stunning picture from the International Space Station (ISS), where he’s been living since last October. That puts him roughly 400 kilometers above Earth, which is more than a bird’s eye view of the Northern Lights which occur in the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere. ‘Absolutely unreal,’ said Cassada in a tweet sharing the picture on tuesday. Cassada arrived at the ISS along with the three other crewmembers of SpaceX’s Crew-5 mission, Nasa’s Nicole Mann, Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and cosmonaut Anna Kikina. This could be the Crew-5’s last week on board the ISS as they’re scheduled to return to Earth about five days after SpaceX’s Crew-6 mission arrives at the space station. On Monday, Nasa and SpaceX aborted the crewed rocket launch two minutes before lift-off. Crew-6 is currently scheduled to be launched early Thursday morning from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
