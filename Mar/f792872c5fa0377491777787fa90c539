Adele delighted a pair of newlyweds at her Las Vegas show who headed straight to her concert after exchanging vows. The singer is currently in the thick of her four-month residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace and has previously touched audiences with her candid behaviour. On Friday though, she was the cherry on top of the (wedding) cake for Gaby and Evan, as she stopped to congratulate them on their marriage mid-song. The Easy On Me chart-topper was walking around the auditorium while belting out 2015 hit When We Were Young, when she stopped to greet the new husband and wife. They were reasonably easy to spot as they were still in their wedding dress and veil and formal suit with buttonhole, respectively. ‘Oh, did you just get married?’ she asked the couple as she held hands with each of them. As they replied, she cackled in excitement and added for the benefit of the rest of the audience: ‘You got married today! Congratulations!’ She then paused to sign Gaby’s white dress with a marker provided by her husband, adding an extra special touch to her keepsake from the day. Ever the relatable queen, Adele initially had a little trouble getting the pen to write and played it for laughs as she paused briefly missed song to try and juggle it with her microphone in the other hand. Evan shared the video of their dream moment to Instagram on Saturday, commenting: ‘@adele please excuse my clammy hands. ‘This was my most major fan girl moment lol,’ and tagging his new wife. Their pals were very impressed by the interaction, flooding the comments. ‘Wasn’t expecting to see this today. That’s dope!’ wrote one, while another posted: ‘Omg that’s freaking amazing 😍😍😍’ Others agreed, calling it ‘rad’ and ‘epic’. As the clip circulated online, more of Adele’s fans praised her as they saw the sweet moment. ‘She signed it mid-singing i’m crying she’s so mother,’ exclaimed one. ‘The multitasking is crazyyyyy… Adele queen!’ tweeted a second. Gaby also shared the video on her Instagram, thanking the singer for ‘creating the memory of a lifetime for us’. She captioned it: ‘Weekends with Adele ✨ My world is made- found the love of my life and this man was determined to have Adele sing at our wedding… 7 years later all our dreams came true. ‘Thank you Adele for creating the memory of a lifetime for us 🥰’ Adele, who recently sparked engagement rumours with her sports agent boyfriend Rich Paul, also shared a picture of her meeting with the couple in a carousel of pictures from her recent shows, which she captioned simply ‘Weekend 14’. She looked glamorous as ever in a black off-the-shoulder Jenny Packham gown with gold embellishments. Got a story?
