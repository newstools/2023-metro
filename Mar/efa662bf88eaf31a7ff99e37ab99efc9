Mikel Arteta singled out one of Arsenal’s star players for his ‘magic moment’ as the Gunners thrashed Everton 4-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday. Bukayo Saka put Arsenal 1-0 up before Gabriel Martinelli doubled the lead just before half-time against Sean Dyche’s side. Martin Odegaard grabbed the third and Martinelli scored again with 10 minutes to play as the north London club cruised to victory at the Emirates. The result means Arsenal are now five points clear of second-placed Manchester City at the top of the table as they look to win their first top-flight title since 2004. Arteta was over the moon with his side’s performance as he told BBC Sport: ‘I am delighted with the win and the way we played after the first 25 minutes. ‘We had some difficulties at the start. They are difficult to play against. Once we scored the first goal, the game unlocked. ‘We needed a magic moment and Bukayo produced that. After that we grew and deserved to win the game. ‘With the way they play, direct, second balls, a small lead isn’t enough. We played really well in the second half and could have scored more. ‘I am delighted when I see the team play the way we want to. This league is a different story [and there is no easy games]. ‘We had big proof of that at Goodison [when Arsenal lost 1-0]. They made it difficult for Liverpool too. ‘I’m really happy with the maturity and quality we showed.’ Saka, 21, is now the sixth youngest player to register 50 Premier League goals and assists combined after Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney, Robbie Fowler, Cesc Fabregas and Chris Sutton. The England international winger has been in fantastic form for the table-topping Gunners this term with 10 goals and nine assists across 25 appearances.
