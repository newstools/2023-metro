Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) will always stick her nose into other people’s business in Coronation Street. It’s just the way she is. Recently, she was asked to supply free flowers for Daisy’s (Charlotte Jordan) wedding and, in return, she would get promotion on social media. Because Tracy doesn’t quite understand the world of Instagram and Twitter, she thought Daisy’s offer was nothing short of hilarious. She declined, basically. With the wedding nearing ever closer and Daisy also having to deal with Justin (Andrew Still), she calls on Tracy for help once more – but will she help out in her hour of need? After Daisy tells Daniel (Rob Mallard) that everyone is back on board with the wedding apart from the florist, she bites the bullet and heads over to Preston’s. Making the offer, Daisy is stunned when Tracy agrees. However, there’s a catch. Tracy tells Daisy that she will provide the flowers for the wedding – but she and Amy (Elle Mulvaney) must be bridesmaids. Honestly, we’re not even the slightest bit surprised Tracy has come up with this deal – but will Daisy agree?
