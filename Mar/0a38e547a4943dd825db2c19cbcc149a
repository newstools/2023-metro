Erik ten Hag has decided on Tottenham forward Harry Kane as his number one target this summer, with Manchester United ready to break their transfer record in order to sign the England captain. United’s reliance on Marcus Rashford has been showcased in recent weeks, despite the winger continuing a good rate of goalscoring. With Rashford missing two good chances in the first half against Liverpool last Sunday, United went on to be punished for their charity in front of goal with a 7-0 defeat at Anfield. Wout Weghorst has added energy and determination at the point of United’s attack, which was sorely missing under Cristiano Ronaldo. But, with Anthony Martial making just 12 appearances this season, United desperately need a centre forward and Ten Hag has been weighing up a move for Kane or Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. At 24, Osimhen is six years Kane’s junior and though he’d probably cost around £120m, the Nigerian would have sell-on value. But the Mirror say Ten Hag has decided that Kane is his first choice and he’s asked the United board to fund a club record move for the striker. United’s transfer record remains the £89m they spent on Paul Pogba in 2016 but Tottenham are expected to demand £100m if Kane pushes to leave at the end of the season. Kane will have 12 months to run on his deal in the summer and though Daniel Levy would prefer to sell abroad, Kane’s determined to break the Premier League scoring record and wants to remain in England. Ten Hag feels Kane can have a ‘Casemiro’ effect on the side, in that his arrival would immediately take the team to the next level.
