The blast of Arctic temperatures will briefly get more mild, but hold on to your umbrellas – it’s about to get windy. Many parts of the UK have shivered through the weekend as cloud and rain spreads in from the west. Temperatures plunged to as low as -15.7C in Altnaharra in northern Scotland, while the highest temperature of 12.C was recorded at St Marys Airport on the Isles of Scilly, south west of Cornwall. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for tomorrow and Tuesday after Storm Larisa battered parts of the UK with gales and blizzards. Drivers were left stranded in heavy snow, while two hill-walking families in north Wales had to be rescued. The emergency services sent teams in 4×4 vehicles to Moel Famau, a hill in the Clwydian Range between Flintshire and Denbighshire. Visibility was down to 100m (328ft) at the time of the calls, while in Northern Ireland, rare snow rollers were spotted in a field. The naturally-occurring phenomenon are the result of strong winds blowing across a flat, snow-covered field or hillside. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
