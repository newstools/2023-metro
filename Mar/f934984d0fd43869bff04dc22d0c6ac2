Proud parents Victoria and David Beckham were quick off the mark to share their love and admiration for daughter Harper Seven on International Women’s Day. The famous couple uploaded separate posts in honour of their only daughter and youngest child on Wednesday. Posh Spice began her gallery of Harper-inspired snaps with a sweet selfie showing the glowing girls as they enjoyed a face mask and cosy night in together. Explaining her images, the former pop star penned: ‘Happy International Women’s Day!! Love you so much #HarperSeven xx @davidbeckham [sic]’. Following suit, husband and ex-professional footballer David included his wife in his nod to the global day of recognition and shared a similar collection of family photos. Posting a picture of Victoria and Harper as they touched noses, the black and white moment was the first of many shots that paid tribute to all the women in his life. Taking a walk down memory lane, the athlete also acknowledged his mother and sisters with throwbacks that showed the famous face as a strapping youngster. He wrote: ‘On this International women’s day I want to celebrate the amazing women in my life who inspire me with their work ethic, loyalty, kindness and love for their families… ‘I feel lucky to have them in my life x Happy international women’s day to all the incredible women around the world x today we celebrate you @victoriabeckham #HarperSeven @sandra_beckham49 @jo_jo_beckham_ @lynnebeckhambriggs1972 @jackie.adams_ [sic]’. The Beckhams weren’t the only stars spreading the love ahead of the day that celebrates the achievements of women everywhere. Katie Price uploaded a reel slideshow to her Instagram page that honoured the ‘women in my family who support and love me’. The imagery showed off her teenage daughter Princess as well as her mother and sister Sophie. Amanda Holden shared a similarly styled tribute to her female friends and family members with her social media following. Stitching together a string of fun-filled smiling pictures, the Britain’s Got Talent judge said: ‘It takes a village doesn’t it? ‘To get through life you need help and love and great people to lift you and sometimes shove a glass of wine in your hand! I feel very lucky and grateful to be surrounded by these incredibly defiant , fabulous women ! ‘I admire them all so much and over the years stood in awe of their achievements! The advice, care and support as well as the endless laughs are something I can’t live without. Side by side. ‘Hand in hand we stand strong -we can achieve anything we can change anything. ( because,bloody hell,there’s still a lot to change ) [sic]’. Breakfast radio co-host and former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts took to her stories to post a selfie with Amanda wishing everyone a ‘happy international women’s day’, as did Vanessa Feltz who posed for a mirror selfie with the day’s Instagram banner. Broadcaster and former footballer Alex Scott graced the cover of Grazia ahead of the symbolic day and revealed her front page pic on social media. Sporting a lime green bodycon cut-out knit dress, the presenter was glowing against a blue background for the magazine’s March issue. Got a story?
