A woman found the body of her dead husband – who was missing for nearly eight months – while looking for Christmas decorations in a closet in their home. Jennifer Maedge reported her husband, Richard, missing on April 27 after speaking with him the day before. Richard had called her saying he was leaving work early. When she got to their home in Troy, Illinois, his car was parked and she found his wallet and keys, but he was nowhere to be found, KTVI reported. Police searched the home and found no hints as to where Richard was, while noticing a ‘sewer-like’ smell, wrote Madison County deputy coroner Kelly Rogers in an autopsy report released on Thursday. Jennifer called cops again later on to report the odor. Officers who searched the house a second time noticed the smell but did not find Richard’s remains. Her husband then called a plumber, who said the odor was sewer gas, according to Rogers. The plumber put a cap on a sewer pipe in the basement and the odor simultaneously seemed to go away. Fast-forward to December 11, Jennifer went to a concealed closet searching for a bag with Christmas decorations. It was there that she found Richard’s body – mummified. ‘I decided to put the Christmas tree up, and I was looking for a tote of Christmas ornaments, and that’s when I discovered him,’ Jennifer told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at the time. ‘He had committed suicide.’ An autopsy report from county coroner Steve Nonn confirmed that. Richard’s body showed no signs of injury or foul play. Richard’s body was beyond the decomposition phase. In the mummification state. all fluids are dried up and the body often does not have a strong odor, Rogers said. The couple’s residence resembled a ‘hoarder home’ – which made it difficult for cops to locate Richard’s body. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
