A man who attacked another with a metal tent pole in McDonald’s has been jailed. Conor Murphy was queuing for food on the A1 in Peterborough when he squared up to the victim’s friend about why she was not wearing a mask. Once they got their orders, the victim and his three friends sat down. On the way out, the 29-year-old approached them again with the same question. When told one was exempt because he had a heart bypass, Murphy went back to his car, grabbing the pole from behind the driver’s seat. Peterborough Magistrates’ Court was told he stormed back to the fast-food chain, striking the victim on the right side of his head. Terrified, the victim’s partner intervened and Murphy hit her on the wrist with the weapon. Onlookers tried to restrain him but he fled the scene, driving away in his car. He was arrested a few days later after handing himself in at Thorpe Wood Police Station. DC Andrea Farnes said: ‘This was a disgusting and pointless assault on someone who was just going about their daily business. ‘Murphy knew what he was doing was incredibly dangerous and he can now reflect on his stupid actions in prison.’ Murphy, of Stamford Lane, Warmington, Northamptonshire, pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon. He was jailed for two years and eight months over the incident on June 29, 2021. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
