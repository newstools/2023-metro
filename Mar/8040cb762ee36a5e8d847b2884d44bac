We all have a lot on our plates right now. Our houses are freezing, money is tight, and redundancy plays on our mind as we continue to struggle through the cost of living crisis. But these stresses are having an impact in more ways than one – including making us feel a lot less in the mood. A new report by sex health and wellness brand Hims, looking into British people’s sex lives, found that the cost of living crisis has had an even bigger impact on our love lives than the pandemic. When you think about it, it’s only natural that all the worrying and scrimping isn’t making us feel very sexy. According to the report, nearly half of the 3,688 respondents (aged between 18-65), said that at least one economic or political event in the last year had affected their sex lives. In fact, around 32% of respondents in total said the cost of living crisis has affected their dating and sex lives. ‘If you are in a housing situation which is stressfully unstable, if you’re having to work around the clock until you’re knackered, or if your health is impacted by poverty, you may well have less time and inclination for sex,’ says sex educator, Alix Fox. Arguments around household bills, financial security, and savings for the future may be contributing as a potential mood killer for couples. There’s also the fact that some may have moved in with parents to save cash, which could be having a knock-on effect on their sex lives. Overall, it’s clear the cost of living crisis is squashing romance and lust for many. If you’re looking for ways to reignite the spark again, experts have suggested a few tips here.
