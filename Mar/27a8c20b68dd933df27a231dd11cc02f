Jude Bellingham felt Chelsea’s retaken penalty in the win over Borussia Dortmund was a ‘joke’ after a frustrating night in the Champions League for the teenage star. The Blues beat the German side 2-0 at Stamford Bridge, securing a 2-1 victory on aggregate and progressing to the quarter-finals. Raheem Sterling put the home side ahead, but then there was controversy over the second goal, which eventually came through Kai Havertz from the penalty spot. The initial decision was harsh on Marius Wolf as handball was given against him when Ben Chilwell hammered a cross into him from close range, but VAR helped give the penalty. Havertz then rolled his effort against the post, with Salih Ozcan clearing the rebound, but replays confirmed the Dortmund midfielder had encroached, so Chelsea were given another go, with Havertz scoring with his second effort. Bellingham watched both decisions after the game and didn’t agree with either, especially baffled by the decision to let Chelsea retake the spot-kick. ‘It’s a yard or two away, I’m not too sure. I don’t want to get in trouble, I’ve paid enough to them lot,’ Bellingham told BT Sport after seeing the handball call. ‘I think that in itself was disappointing and the fact that they’ve had a retake, I think it’s a joke. ‘For every penalty, especially when he has such a slow run up, there’s going to be people encroaching into the box by a yard or so. ‘But that’s the game I suppose, he’s made the decision and we’ve had to live with it.’ It was a difficult night for Bellingham, who missed a great chance to score and showed his frustration late on as he was booked for a heavy and reckless challenge on Reece James.
