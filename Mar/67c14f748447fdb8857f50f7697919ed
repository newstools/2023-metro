Police are on the hunt to find a man who allegedly battered a commuter with a pole before robbing him in Lewisham, south east London. The Met has released a CCTV image of a man they’d like to speak to in connection with the robbery. Police say the assault resulted in a life-threatening head injury. The incident took place after the victim got off a bus in Rushey Green, SE6, just before 8am on Saturday, December 10, 2022. He was walking through Lewisham when an unknown man approached him from behind and repeatedly hit him over the head with a metal pole. A bag was taken from the victim before the suspect left and boarded a 185 bus to Victoria. The man, who is in his 20s, was taken to a London hospital after being left with a serious head injury. A hospital scan showed that he suffered a bleed on the brain and his injuries were originally classed as life-threatening. He has since been discharged from hospital. Detective Sergeant Laura Warden, from the South East area’s Robbery Squad, said: ‘This was an extremely violent robbery, which left the victim fighting for his life. ‘We are determined to bring the person responsible for this heinous crime to justice.’ She went on to add: We have now released an image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with the robbery. ‘It is a very clear image, so if that is you in the picture or if you know who it is, then please contact us as soon as possible.’ Anyone with any information should contact police on 1010 quoting reference CAD 1558/10Dec22.
