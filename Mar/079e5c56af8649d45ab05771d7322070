Saturday Night Takeaway viewers are demanding if ‘Shrek is OK’ after the green monster took a nasty tumble. We’d like to say no creatures were harmed on Ant and Dec’s beloved ITV programme but Shrek suffered a bit of a fall. In a segment of the show, which also featured Daisy May Cooper and Claudia Winkleman, a gang of colourful characters took to the stage. But after parading in the studio, Shrek appeared to misjudge his step and stumbled. Eagle-eyed fans noticed the incident on Twitter, with one saying: ‘Is Shrek okay after he decked it? #SaturdayNightTakeaway.’ ‘Can somebody please check on Shrek?!’ a viewer demanded, while another sympathised: ‘Poor Shrek.’ The moment didn’t go unnoticed by Stephen Mulhearn who reassured the audience Shrek was ‘absolutely fine’ after joking he’d paid a visit to A&E. Let’s hope that Shrek is getting some R&R. Also on tonight’s episode, the audience were left in tears after Rihanna asked Nick if he would formally adopt her. After of course saying yes, an emotional Nick said: ‘It means everything, she’s an absolute diamond. It’s priceless.’ Saturday Night Takeaway continues on Saturday on ITV at 7pm. Got a story?
