This is the awkward moment a driver stuck his middle finger up to passing motorists. Footage captured by Avon and Somerset Police shows the man carelessly talking on his mobile phone while driving. Annoyed that he is being filmed, he puts the phone down before flipping off the car next to him. What the man does not know at the time is that this was undercover police in an unmarked vehicle. An officer recording the clip can be heard saying, ‘Oh dear’, followed by a hearty chuckle. ‘Okay, we have got one for you. He just stuck a middle finger up at me,’ she adds. Police say his response showed the ‘total disregard’ some people have for the law. Avon and Somerset Police Roads Policing teams said in a statement on Twitter: ‘Officers conducting mobile phone enforcement in an unmarked vehicle observed this driver on his phone. ‘His reaction, before noticing that the person recording him was a police officer, shows the totally disregard some people have for the law and road safety.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
