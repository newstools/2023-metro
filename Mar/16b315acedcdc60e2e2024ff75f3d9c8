LED masks have long been used in the skincare regimes of Hollywood stars’ with thousands spent on the most powerful technology to reduce blemishes and tackle wrinkles while working lotions and potions deeper into the skin. Up until recently LED facials have been confined to the luxurious chambers of high-end spas and salons, only booked by those with some serious pennies in the bank, or if you had the equivalent of a mortgage payment to spend on a fancy mask. But now, SwearBySkin has developed its own LED face mask that aims to give you all the benefits but, and this is the best bit, without the sky-high price. ‘You may see quicker results with a very expensive device, but unsurprisingly, not everyone has a spare £500 to spend,’ says SwearBy Skin founder Shenae Rae, and we can totally relate. The pain-free treatments claim to have a multitude of skincare benefits and aim to reduce acne, help fade hyperpigmentation, stimulate collagen and fight the signs of ageing. At just £80, it has three functions that are built to reduce oil and bacteria on your skin, calm pigmentation and blemishes, and also smooth and firm the skin. You only have to put it on for 10 minutes up to four times a week. As one of the most affordable LED masks available, we had to try it.
