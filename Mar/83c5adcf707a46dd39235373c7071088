Gary Lineker is reportedly being eyed up by BT Sport after the BBC axed him from Match of the Day. Outrage has been sparked after the Line of Duty broadcaster made the decision to remove the pundit from MOTD over his stance on the UK’s migration policy. The 62-year-old had compared the Home Office’s plans to block boats arriving to the UK to 1930s Germany. Lineker’s fellow presenters, including Alan Shearer and Ian Wright, have also pulled out of the show in ‘solidarity’ with the father-of-four. The broadcaster will now air a 20-minute and silent MOTD following the revolt, with other BBC sports journalists, including Alex Scott, refusing to front their shows. According to the Daily Mail, BT Sport ‘wants’ Lineker to become the face of their rebranded football coverage next season. BT Sport will be relaunched as TNT Sports this summer after being taken over by Warner Brothers Discovery and is reportedly looking into shaking up its talent. It comes amid a statement from the BBC’s director-general Tim Davie who apologised to audiences for the disruption to the corporation’s sports programming schedule. In an interview in Washington DC, he continued: ‘As a keen sports fan I know to miss programming is a real blow and I’m sorry about that. ‘We are working very hard to resolve this situation and make sure we get output on air.’ However, he vowed not to resign over the fallout.
