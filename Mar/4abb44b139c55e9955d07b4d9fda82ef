As we look to save the pennies in all areas, lots of our coffee shop hot drinks are being swapped for homemade alternatives. Some have even gone as far as to invest in milk frothers and velvetisers to upgrade their homemade offerings – and, ultimately, save money in the long-run. If you’re looking to take your DIY coffees and hot chocolates up a notch, it could be time to pay a visit to Morrisons. The supermarket has just unveiled a new range of sweet sugar toppings for hot drinks. Brought to the attention of the general public by Instagram account New Foods UK (@newfoodsuk), it seems the sugar dusting comes in three flavours: cinnamon, chocolate and caramel. So you’re one step closer to recreating your coffee shop order at home. It’s safe to say that many are sharing how they plan to use these goodies – with one person replying to the post saying they would be good sprinkled on top of an espresso martini. While another suggested using them on popcorn to flavour it. However, others have pointed out that Tesco and Aldi already offer similar products in stores. Looking for more sweet treats? According to New Foods UK, Terry’s Chocolate Orange ice cream is now a thing in Iceland – as well as Honeycomb and Salted Caramel Mars bars in B&M. Do you have a story to share?
