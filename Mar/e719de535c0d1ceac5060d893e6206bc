Prince Harry is following in his mum’s footsteps, supporting the fight against the HIV and Aids. Diana, the Princess of Wales, changed the public’s perception of how the virus was spread when she shook hands with a patient without the protection of gloves. With a single gesture, the royal showed this was a condition needing compassion, not ignorance. The Duke of Sussex paid an emotional tribute to his mum for her work helping to destigmatise the virus. Marking 40 years of the Terrence Higgins Trust, he warned to ‘not slow down now, we must finish the job’. Harry wrote in a message to the trust: ‘I have been involved with Terrence Higgins Trust for a number of years, and the fight to end this epidemic is a big piece of my mum’s legacy. ‘Like many, my mum grew up in a world where HIV was likely a death sentence. ‘Yet, in the midst of that uncertainty, she led with empathy, finding the humanity in all around her and demonstrating the power of connection in the face of fear. ‘While my mum did not live to see the success of today’s treatments, I feel immense pride in being able to continue her advocacy with you.’ The trust has pledged to make England the first country to end new HIV cases by 2030. The duke urged people to support the drive by ‘encouraging testing’ and further donations. He said: ‘They need all of us to do our part by encouraging testing so we all know our status, eradicating stigma that thrives on silence, and donating the resources Terrence Higgins Trust needs to keep up their efforts at pace. ‘Though the last 40 years have shown significant progress, we cannot slow down now, we must finish the job.’ His message appears in the trust’s auction catalogue, with the fundraising sale including art by Tracey Emin and Antony Gormley taking place at Christie’s in London today.
