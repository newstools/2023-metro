An eyewitness described the aftermath as ‘terrifying’, adding: ‘The victim lost an awful lot of blood and had chunks missing from his arm. ‘He sustained gunshots and was butchered by a machete – the garage resembled a slaughterhouse. ‘There were too many people there – around 30 to 40 people within minutes.’ Police have confirmed the victim remains in critical condition as of this afternoon. They said this was a targeted attack and are treating it as attempted murder. Another resident said they rushed outside after hearing ‘two really loud gunshots’. ‘My husband said he had heard screaming and we went out to have a look,’ they recalled. ‘We went to the house and there was a young man on the floor in the garage. ‘There was so much blood everywhere and his family were crying and trying to help staunch the flow of blood with rags.
