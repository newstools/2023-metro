Getting your favourite Gail’s treats (we’re looking at you cinnamon bun and chicken parmesan sandwich) is about to get even easier – if you have a car that is. The popular bakery chain is planning to open drive-thru branches in London and the south east. Currently, the business is searching for sites between 2,000 sq ft and 4,000 sq ft, with space for at least 20 cars, across London. According to Propel Hospitality, Gail’s has recruited property advisor Forty Group to make this happen – with the plan to secure ten locations within the next year. Following in the footsteps of McDonald’s, Costa, Tim Hortons and Krispy Kreme, Gail’s co-founder and chief executive Tom Molnar previously revealed in an interview they are looking for new formats to help the roll-out of the brand. He said: ‘We are first and foremost a bakery, so it’s about the kitchen, and then if we have space for seating, we will add it in. ‘We are always experimenting with new formats as it allows us to take advantage of different real estate opportunities that present themselves.’ While no exact locations are confirmed just yet, there’s no doubt the news will go down a treat with pastry lovers, who will soon be able to collect their oat lattes and sourdough without even leaving their vehicle.
