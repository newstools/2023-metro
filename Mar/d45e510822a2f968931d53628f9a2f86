A man has been arrested at the scene of a fatal car crash where the victims’ loved ones had gathered to lay flowers. Thomas Taylor, 47, was involved in an incident near a section of the A48 at St Mellons, Cardiff, which had been cordoned off after a car was found in a wooded area just off the road. Its five occupants had been the subject of a huge missing persons enquiry after disappearing in the early hours on Saturday. It wasn’t until shortly after midnight on Sunday that police announced it had been found, and that three of the people inside had died while two were rushed to hospital. Before his arrest, Taylor, a film and TV extra from Cardiff thought to have arrived at the scene on a bicycle, said: ‘When I heard the reports, I just couldn’t believe it could be possible that a car could come off and no-one know they were there. ‘I still don’t understand it. It worries me, and I feel for the families because from what I can see from the reports they did have a feeling something was wrong and they were flagging it up. Their instincts were correct. ‘I have some fears that perhaps when the reports came they had gone missing people thought: “Oh, it’s just a night out”. ‘It’s natural they might have disappeared for a bit, but the families’ instincts are right.’ It’s understood he was asked to leave the area. Gwent Police said he was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace. The deceased have been named as Eve Smith and Darcy Ross, both from Maesglas, and Rafel Jeanne, from Cardiff. Sophie Russon and Shane Loughlin remained in critical condition in hospital on Monday afternoon. Detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the crash and the force has referred itself to the independent police watchdog over the case.
