Shocking video has shown the moment an oblivious pedestrian was just inches away from being hit by a speeding train. The alarming footage, captured by on board cameras, shows the man casually walking across the crossing in Runcorn, Cheshire. The train, which was the London Euston to Glasgow service, was forced to come to an emergency stop so it didn’t hit the pedestrian. According to Network Rail, the maximum speed for trains on this section of line is 125mph. The crossing displays a red warning light when it is unsafe to cross, which the man ignored. Lucy Jordan, Network Rail’s North West head of safety, said the incident on January 18, could have ‘led to tragedy’. She said: ‘When I see footage like this it always make my heart stop. ‘The difference of just a few seconds could have led to tragedy for this man and I can’t downplay the danger he was in. ‘It’s important for Network Rail to share this video as a strong warning to others and to remind them of our level crossing rules. ‘No matter how well you think you know a crossing, all users must obey the signage in place and if there are warning lights, always stop when they display red, it just isn’t worth the risk.’ Dave Whitehouse, Avanti West Coast safety and security director, said the footage is a ‘stark reminder’ to be ‘aware of your surroundings near the railways.’ He said: ‘This footage serves as a stark reminder to be aware of your surroundings near the railways whether it’s at a level crossing or at a station. ‘Although the man involved escaped serious injury, this shows it’s only takes a split second to make the wrong decision for it to end in tragedy.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
