Gary Lineker has spoken out after the news that he’s to have a ‘talking to’ by the BBC after he appeared to compare the UK government’s asylum policy to the rule of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. On Tuesday March 7, the government announced what it described as ‘ground-breaking new laws to stop the boats’, in an effort to prevent people from entering the UK illegally. The plans would effectively stop anyone from claiming asylum in the UK if they entered the country illegally, with home secretary Suella Braverman stating: ‘If you come here illegally, you won’t be able to claim asylum or build a life here.’ Pundit Lineker responded to a video posted online of Braverman speaking about the policy, remarking: ‘Good heavens, this is beyond awful.’ He then added in response to a critic: ‘There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I’m out of order?’ Following criticism from Tory politicians, including Braverman, a BBC spokesperson has said that Lineker will be spoken to and ‘reminded of his responsibilities’. The 62-year-old first spoke out in a tweet published this morning in a nonchalant manner, stating: ‘Morning all. Anything going on?’ He then followed up by calling out ‘freedom of speech champions’, who he claimed didn’t want to hear the opinions of people who didn’t share their views. ‘Great to see the freedom of speech champions out in force this morning demanding silence from those with whom they disagree. 👊🏻,’ he wrote. He later expressed his gratitude for the ‘love and support’ that he received from people online, writing: ‘I have never known such love and support in my life than I’m getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). ‘I want to thank each and every one of you. It means a lot. I’ll continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no voice. Cheers all.’I want to thank each and every one of you. It means a lot. I’ll continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no voice. Cheers all.’ Braverman responded to Lineker’s remarks while being interviewed on Good Morning Britain, saying that she was ‘very disappointed’ with his comments. ‘Equating our measures – which are lawful, necessary and fundamentally compassionate – to 1930s Germany is irresponsible and I disagree with that characterisation,’ she told the ITV programme. When asked if she thinks Lineker should resign or be sacked from his position at the BBC, the politician replied: ‘That’s a matter for the BBC and they will resolve that.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper also voiced her opinion on his tweets, saying that she doesn’t think it’s ‘ said she does not think it is “’right to make comparisons with the 1930s’, while adding that ‘people can have their own views’. Meanwhile immigration minister Robert Jenrick added to Times Radio: ‘My children are the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors and I think those sorts of words should not be thrown around lightly. ‘Gary Lineker is paid for by the British taxpayer and it’s disappointing that he is so far out of step with the British public.’ Got a story?
