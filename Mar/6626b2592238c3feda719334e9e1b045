Joe Cole has warned teams that they ‘won’t want to play Chelsea in the next couple of weeks’ and labelled Kai Havertz ‘outstanding’ after Tuesday’s win. The Blues defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-0 at Stamford Bridge to book their place in the Champions League quarter-finals as Havertz netted the winner. Graham Potter’s side went into the clash against the German side having won just three of their last 16 matches but have now made it back-to-back victories. It has been a tough season for the west London club who suffered early exits from the domestic cups and are currently 10th in the Premier League. But their last two wins could be a huge turning point for Chelsea who next face Leicester City, Everton, Aston Villa and Liverpool as they look to climb the table. Former Chelsea star Cole, speaking to BT Sport after the Blues’ triumph over Dortmund, said: ‘Enjoy it, enjoy it! ‘There’s huge pressure to play for any top club but particularly Chelsea over the last few years because you knew [under Roman Abramovich] if you lost two, three or four games than the manager would be out the door. ‘The next one might not like you, so you are never comfortable. No-one at this club has ever been comfortable, not the players. ‘So you take all that change [under new owner Todd Boehly], all the noise around it and you get a performance like tonight. ‘There were little sparks of it on Saturday [in the win over Leeds]. ‘Little patterns of play were starting to work. Kai Havertz coming into the game, he was absolutely outstanding tonight. Forget what it took to retake that penalty. ‘It’s a big, big moment in the season. A huge moment for Chelsea and you won’t want to be playing Chelsea in the next couple of weeks.’ MORE : Graham Potter admits Chelsea enjoyed ‘a little bit of luck’ during Dortmund win MORE : Chelsea book spot in Champions League quarter-finals after penalty controversy
