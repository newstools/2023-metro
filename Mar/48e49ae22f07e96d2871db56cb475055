A guest who appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show has reportedly died. Deon ‘Mad Dog’ Hulse, who made a memorable appearance on the ITV daytime programme in 2011, in an episode titled ‘How Could My Boyfriend Destroy His Own Face?’, died ‘peacefully in his sleep’ according to his family. They’ve now set up a Go Fund Me page for his funeral costs, writing: ‘He touched a lot of people’s hearts. ‘Many of us will always have a story to tell about him. ‘He was a one off and one in a trillion.’ The episode saw Hulse tell Kyle: ‘I don’t care what I look like. ‘I am who I am, if people don’t like me for who I am, they can do one. ‘What’s wrong with it? I’m still the same person inside.’ During the episode, the then 27-year-old left his girlfriend Catherine less than impressed with his new look, after getting his entire face tattooed in a skull design. Catherine told the talkshow host that she thought Hulse was joking when he first suggested the extreme tattoo and the talk show host admitted that he too was puzzled why anyone would want to do such a thing. ‘I’m slightly struggling as to why anyone would have a skull tattooed on their face,’ Kyle said. After a failed lie detector test, Kyle labelled the father-of-two a ‘liar and a cheat’. ‘You look ridiculous,’ he added. Got a story?
