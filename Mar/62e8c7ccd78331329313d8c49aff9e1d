Manchester United winger Facundo Pellistri could be set for a more prominent role in the side before the end of the season after Erik ten Hag admitted his decision to overlook him against Liverpool was not ‘justified’. The 21-year-old hasn’t made a single start for United this season but he’s impressed in his six substitute appearances. In fact, Pellistri’s only two starts of the 2022/23 campaign came for Uruguay at the World Cup. The Uruguayan joined United in 2020 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, having been tipped off about his talent by former striker Diego Forlan. But Pellistri’s had to be patient for a chance, given the competition for places in wide areas at Old Trafford. Of the substitute appearances that Pellestri’s made this season, Thursday’s against Real Betis was the most impressive as the winger played a vital part in setting up Wout Weghorst’s goal and came close to scoring one of his own. And, after admitting he should have picked Pellistri against Liverpool, Ten Hag says the winger deserves more minutes before the season finishes. ‘He is the example by deserving his position by performance on the training [ground],’ said Ten Hag.‘And I said the other day, I did not select him for Liverpool and it was not even totally justified because he was training that well. “Now this was his moment to come on because of a longer period he performed in training. What impressed me was he came on and, straight [away], showed himself. ‘When they came on, Scott [McTominay] and Pelli, it was 3-1 but 4-1 is huge, to make the extra goal. In the first moment, they did, which was brilliant.’ MORE : Why Manchester United are wearing black armbands against Southampton MORE : Match of the Day 2 to go ahead in same format as MOTD with no presenter or commentary as Gary Lineker support continues For more stories like this, check our sport page.
