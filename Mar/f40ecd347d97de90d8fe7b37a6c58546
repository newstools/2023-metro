Netflix viewers couldn’t help but point out an error in Chris Rock’s savage takedown of Will Smith. The legendary comic, 58, made history this weekend after becoming the first artist to have a show live-streamed globally on the platform. Titled Chris Rock: Selective Outrage, the hour-long special streamed in the early hours of Sunday morning in the UK and featured Chris fully addressing Will Smith slapping him at the Oscars for the first time. The Grown Ups star said: ‘The thing people wanna know … did it hurt? Hell yeah, it hurt. He played Muhammad Ali! ‘I played Pookie (in ‘New Jack City’). Even in animated movies, I’m a zebra, he’s a f*****g shark. I got hit so hard, I heard ‘Summertime’ ringing in my ears.’ Chris was addressing Will’s 2004 animation film Shark Tale – which also stars Angelina Jolie and Jack Black. However, Will didn’t play a shark in the comedy, he played a fish. One fan tweeted: ‘Chris Rock’s set was pretty inconsistent, but when it was funny, it was really funny. He only really talked about Will Smith at the very end, & I can’t decide if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. Eh, I think it’s the former… ‘(Oh, & he CLEARLY needs to rewatch Shark Tale).’ ‘Chris rock has been polishing material about will smith” and yet he says that will smith played the shark in shark tale,’ another added. During the hour-long show, Chris explained how the title for his Netflix special had connections to Will and poked fun at the actor’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith making the bombshell admission in 2020 that she had an ‘entanglement’ with singer August Alsina while she and Will were on a break, a revelation the pair later discussed on her Red Table Talk show. ‘Will Smith practices selective outrage. Everybody that really knows knows I had nothing to do with that s***. I didn’t have any entanglements,’ Chris told the audience who were in hysterics throughout the whole bit. He continued: ‘His wife was f****** her son’s friend. Now, I normally would not talk about this s***, but for some reason, these n***** put that s*** on the internet. I have no idea why two people that talented would do something that low-down. ‘We all been cheated on. Everybody in here has been cheated on. None of us have ever been interviewed by the person that cheated on us on television. None of us. … Why the f*** would you do that s***? She hurt him way more than he hurt me, okay?’ Chris Rock: Selective Outrage is available to stream on Netflix. Got a story?
