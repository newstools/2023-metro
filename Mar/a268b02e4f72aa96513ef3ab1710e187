Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar has vowed to ‘come back stronger’ after his season-ending injury was confirmed on Monday. The Brazil international is set to miss the rest of the 2022-23 campaign as he needs surgery on his right ankle. Neymar, plagued by injuries in recent years, sustained the latest problem during PSG’s 4-3 victory over Lille on February 19 in Ligue 1. The 31-year-old took to Instagram to address the news as he posted: ‘I’ll come back stronger.’ Neymar, who joined PSG from Barcelona for a world-record £200m fee in 2017, is now set for another three to four months on the sidelines. ‘Neymar Jr has sustained a number of instances of instability in his right ankle in recent years,’ PSG said in a statement. ‘Following his latest sprain, the Paris Saint-Germain medical staff recommended a ligament repair operation to avoid a major risk of recurrence. ‘All the experts consulted have confirmed this necessity. The surgery will be performed in the next few days at the ASPETAR hospital in Doha. ‘It will take 3 to 4 months before he can return to training with the team.’ Neymar was forced to miss two of Brazil’s games at the World Cup in Qatar after picking up an injury in their opener and also missed the Copa America in 2019. He was out for several weeks in 2021 with a similar injury and his latest setback is a huge blow for French club PSG, who face Bayern Munich in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday, looking to recover from their 1-0 first-leg defeat. Neymar, part of a lethal attacking trio which also includes Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi, has registered 18 goals and 17 assists across 29 games this term. In total, he has scored 118 goals and made 77 assists in 173 matches for the French champions.
