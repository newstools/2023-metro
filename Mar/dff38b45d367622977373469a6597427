Products are tested and reviewed independently of commercial initiatives. We know mums come in all shapes and sizes, but often the gifts on offer for their special day just don’t reflect that. While a novelty mug or tacky personalised trinket may do the trick on Mother’s Day when you’re young, it gets old quick. Rather than picking up the same old pieces from the seasonal aisle of your local supermarket, why not look for something a little different this year? We’ve picked out some gift ideas for the non-mumsy mums out there; the matriarchs who don’t fit the floral, fluffy, hyperfeminine stereotype and want products that suit their tastes. There’s nothing wrong with a bit of chintz, but if you look for something specific that’s useful or stylish there’s less chance it’ll be resigned to the cupboards once Mother’s Day is done. This year’s celebration falls on Sunday March 19, so you’ve got time to find that perfect present. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
