The mother of Nicola Payne who disappeared more than 30 years ago has died not knowing what happened to her daughter. Nicola was 18 when she vanished in thick fog walking across wasteland in Coventry on December 14, 1991. Despite numerous searches of homes, rivers and woodland over the years, no trace of her body has ever been found. Her parents Marilyn, 77, and John, also 77, never gave up and made regular appeals for help finding their daughter. But in a post on the Find Nicola Payne Facebook page, her family wrote: ‘Nicola’s family are devastated to announce the death of her mum, Marilyn Payne. ‘A tenacious woman who never gave up on finding her daughter and laying her to rest. ‘The bravery she showed was extraordinary, and now her determination will continue through her family and many friends in order to finally bring Nicola home.’ Marilyn and John last made a public appeal in 2021 on the 30th anniversary of Nicola’s disappearance. Nicola had left her seven-month-old son Owen with boyfriend Jason Cooke at his home while she visited her parents a five-minute walk away. She walked across wasteland known as Black Pad but never made it to her parents’ home in Woodway Close. Her family was given fresh hope when an anonymous donor put up a £100,000 reward for information. Former detective Mark Williams-Thomas and forensic expert Peter Faulding also launched an investigation, but the case went cold. Several arrests were made over the years but a bungled police investigation resulted in two suspects being acquitted. The family’s campaign will now be led by Nicola’s brothers Scott, 55, and Nigel, 57, and her cousin Amanda Eales, 42. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
