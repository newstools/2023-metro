Many of us enjoy a steak as a dinner treat, but one shoplifter’s eyes were a bit bigger than his stomach. The wanted man was found with a haul of 21-day matured rump stakes and sizzle steaks stuffed in his coat pockets. Pork loins and stolen toys were also on his person. The man was chased by police officers in Salford, Greater Manchester, this afternoon. He was detained a short time later. Sharing a picture of the items, GMP’s Traffic Unit wrote: ‘Male wanted for six months on a prison recall was spotted by an RPU officer in Salford this afternoon. ‘This criminal had the audacity to make the RPU cop get out of his 4×4 and chase him on foot. When detained he was found to have a large quantity of stolen property in his coat.’ There was a similar incident in April 2020 when a thief was caught on CCTV stealing a food delivery that was destined for an elderly man living by himself. The masked man struck just 30 minutes after milk, bread and eggs were delivered in the early hours, brazenly walking up and making off with the goods in Swindon, Wiltshire. Veronica Zarola, 55, and her husband Vito realised what happened when they checked their security camera to see if the food had been delivered. They saw the package arriving at their home in Swindon, Wiltshire, at 2am, and later watched in horror as the hooded figure struck. The food had been ordered for Veronica’s elderly father Bruno, 83, who was isolating due to coronavirus. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
