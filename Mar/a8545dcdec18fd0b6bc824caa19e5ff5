Arsenal face a potential charge from the Football Association for their celebrations during the 3-2 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday. The Gunners appeared on course for their second defeat at home in the Premier League season as Bournemouth were two goals ahead by 57 minutes. Thomas Partey and Ben White pulled Mikel Arteta’s side level before Reiss Nelson triggered jubilant scenes at the Emirates Stadium with his winning goal in the seventh minute of injury time. The win has kept Arsenal five points clear of Manchester City, who had beaten Newcastle United earlier that day, at the top of the Premier League. Nelson was joined by Arsenal’s substitutes and non-playing staff on the pitch during the celebrations before the final whistle. And the FA is now investigating the incident after it was referenced in the report submitted by referee Chris Kavanagh’s after the game. IFAB laws state that coaching staff and substitutes in the technical area ‘must behave in a responsible manner’. The laws also state that they ‘must remain within its confines except in special circumstances, e.g. a physiotherapist/doctor entering the field of play, with the referee’s permission, to assess an injured player’. If the FA go ahead with disciplinary proceedings, it will be the fourth time Arsenal have been charged this season. Meanwhile, Bournemouth manager Gary O’Neil insisted he had no complaints about Arsenal’s celebrations. ‘I’ve no comment to make on what Arsenal did. I shook hands with Mikel, it was a game he needed to win and I needed something from it too,’ he said. ‘We went to battle and he came out on top. They scored the goal, so they can celebrate however they like.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
