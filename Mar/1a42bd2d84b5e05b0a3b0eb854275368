A disciplinary panel has recommended an MP be suspended from Parliament for five days. As MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark in London, Neil Coyle had already had the Labour whip suspended after two separate alcohol-fuelled incidents. One saw Mr Coyle verbally abuse another MP’s parliamentary assistant, and he also made racist comments to a British-Chinese journalist. The incidents took place just a day apart and happened at the same location – in the Strangers Bar on the Westminster parliamentary estate. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP), which oversees appeals and sanctions in cases of bullying and other complaints, issued a report today recommending Mr Coyle be suspended for five full parliamentary days. Noting Mr Coyle will be away from Parliament next week, the IEP said it expected this would take place at a time he would otherwise be expected at Westminster. The panel further suggested the MP issue a public apology for his conduct from the floor of the House of Commons. Responding to the report today in a statement on Twitter, Mr Coyle said: ‘I’m deeply sorry for my offensive behaviour and language last year. ‘I have lived and worked in China, have multiple Chinese family members, and serve a vibrant, diverse community and acknowledge the hurt and upset that I caused.’ According to the IEP’s report, Mr Coyle was engaged in a ‘heated debate’ with another MP’s assistant on the evening of January 31, 2022 at the Stranger’s Bar. The exchange ended with Mr Coyle shouting at the unidentified assistant, saying ‘f**k you, f**k you, f**k off’. He then called the assistant a ‘c**t’. The following day, Mr Coyle was again at the Stranger’s Bar when he started talking to Henry Dyer, a British-Chinese journalist working for Business Insider at the time. The pair were discussing Barry Gardiner – a Labour MP who received funds from a Chinese spy – when Mr Coyle suggested that Mr Gardiner had been ‘paid by Fu Manchu’, a cartoon villain boasting sinophobic tropes. After finding out the journalist was half-Chinese, Mr Coyle later told Mr Dyer he looked as though he had been the one to pay off Mr Gardiner. The MP also stuck two fingers up at the journalist when he went to leave the bar that evening. Mr Dyer subsequently said he had felt especially compelled to raise a complaint over the incident ‘given the fact that racism and hate crimes against Chinese, East Asian, and South East Asian people are reported to have increased during the pandemic’. He added: ‘Stereotyping someone because of their ethnicity should not happen to anyone. ‘I hope this raises awareness of the issues of anti-Asian racism and of inappropriate conduct, especially where alcohol is involved.’ The IEP noted in its report Mr Coyle had told the panel he had given up drinking since the incident last year. Mr Coyle added in his statement: ‘I’m ashamed that alcohol had become so problematic in my life that I had developed a dependency. ‘I’m pleased to have managed a full year without alcohol. [It] no longer negatively affects my judgement, relationships or behaviour. ‘I will remain teetotal and I’m hugely grateful to the people in Southwark who have given me so much and been so amazingly supportive.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
