Croydon University Hospital said the patients were taken to other parts of the hospital to continue their treatment after the blaze broke out at around 3pm. The Daily Mirror reported that a room on the ground floor of the hospital is ‘one hundred per cent destroyed’ due to the fire. The hospital said its emergency department would stay closed ‘temporarily’, and urged people in the local community to call 111 if they need urgent care so they can be directed to their nearest services. A statement said: ‘Our staff and the London Fire Brigade responded quickly to the alarm, which was raised at 14:58. ‘A total of 80 patients were safely evacuated from the Emergency Department to continue their care in other parts of the hospital, and we have discharged those patients who are well enough to go home.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
