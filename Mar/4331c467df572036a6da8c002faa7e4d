TikTok announced that in the coming weeks, it will automatically limit daily screen time to 60 minutes for users below the age of 18. The new restrictions are part of the a set of default features the Chinese-owned social media giant is rolling out to improve the wellbeing of the teens who use the app. ‘Every account belonging to someone below age 18 will automatically be set to a 60-minute daily screen time limit,’ said TikTok. ‘If teens decide to turn off this new default limit, and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok in a day, we’ll prompt them to set a daily screen time limit for themselves,’ TikTok said that in first month of testing, this approach increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234%. Teens will also get a weekly notification with a recap of their screen time for that week. Since managing screen time on TikTok is a problem for most people, everyone will soon be able to set up customised screen time limits for each day of the week and a schedule to mute notifications. TikTok has also updated its ‘Family Pairing’ feature introduced in 2020, giving parents the ability to set a custom daily screen time limit for their teens. A screen time dashboard will provide caregivers with summaries of time spent on the app, the number of times TikTok was opened, and a breakdown of the total time spent during the day and night. Parents can also set a custom schedule to mute their kids’ TikTok notifications.
