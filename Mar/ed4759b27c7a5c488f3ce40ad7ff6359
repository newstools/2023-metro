An independent disciplinary hearing into snooker’s match-fixing scandal will begin in April, midway through the biggest event of the season, the World Championship in Sheffield. 10 players are currently suspended having been hit with a range of charges relating to match-fixing on the professional tour. They will remain suspended until the completion of proceedings, so none of them will play again this season as the hearing begins on 24 April, which is during the final event of the current campaign. A WPBSA statement on Thursday read: ‘Sport Resolutions have appointed Ian Mill KC to chair the Independent Disciplinary Hearing for the ten snooker players charged with serious breaches of the WPBSA Conduct Regulations. A date of 24th April 2023 has been set for the start of the proceedings. ‘The players will remain suspended until the outcome of the Independent Disciplinary Hearing is published. They will therefore not participate in any remaining World Snooker Tour events during the 2022/23 season, including the 2023 World Snooker Championship.’ Zhao Xintong, the highest-ranked of the suspended players, is at number nine in the world but will not be able to take his place at the Crucible as a top 16 seed due to the suspension. Yan Bingtao was in the top 16 when he was suspended December, but has since slipped down the rankings and would have had to qualify for the Crucible even if he was able to compete. Due to their positions in the rankings Chen Zifan, Li Hang, Liang Wenbo, Chang Bingyu and Zhang Jiankang are now all set to drop off tour at the end of the season.
