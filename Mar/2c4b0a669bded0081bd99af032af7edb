Sean Dyche claims Arsenal have the look of Premier League champions following their 4-0 victory over Everton on Wednesday evening. Mikel Arteta’s side have moved five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League following their win at the Emirates Stadium. Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli gave the Gunners the lead before the break, while Martin Odegaard extended the hosts’ advantage in the second half before Martinelli netted his second of the game with 10 minutes remaining. Speaking after the game, Dyche hailed Arsenal’s performance and believes their tireless work rate under Arteta has played a key role in their current league position. ‘They played well in the first period but they couldn’t break us down, and that was pleasing for us, lots of teams have to do that at places like this, we know that,’ Dyche told Premier League Productions. ‘Second half they showed what a side they are. ‘I said to my players, ‘what you’ve got to remember is it’s not just about their ability’. At the end they’re closing down, they’re pressing, they save one off the line because they’re throwing bodies at it. ‘That’s what wins titles. That’s the feeling of a group that wins titles. ‘I’m not saying they’ve won it by any means, Man City are fantastic but you look at their work ethic. ‘They knew because they came to Goodison, we put in a real shift and gathered a way of playing to protect a lead as well and seeing the game through, they [Arsenal] responded. ‘That’s what I said to the players, ‘the top teams learn, now it’s about us learning’.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
