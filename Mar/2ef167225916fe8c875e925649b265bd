Amy Barlow is at the centre of a hard hitting Coronation Street storyline, as she deals with the discovery that she has been raped by friend Aaron Sandford (James Craven). Viewers will see her come to terms with her ordeal and slowly open up to friends and family, as she struggles to deal with the emotions that come with an experience like this. For many fans, Amy Barlow feels like a member of the family, as they have watched her grow from a baby to a young woman. But exactly how old is she, and who is the actress taking on this challenging topic? Amy Barlow was born February 9 2004, making her 19-years-old. She is the daughter of Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), though her birth wasn’t without controversy. Scheming Tracy lied about Amy’s parentage, claiming that her father was actually Roy Cropper (David Neilson). Tracy then sold her to him and wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondalgh), who named her Patience. It wasn’t long before the truth came out and the baby, now called Amy, was returned. Amy Barlow is currently played by 20-year-old actress Elle Mulvaney, who took on the role at age 7 back in 2010. Before Elle, the role was played by a number of of other girls, most of whom were babies. During her 13-year stint on the show, Elle has been involved in many of Amy’s biggest storylines, including one which saw her become pregnant at just 14-years old. It was recently revealed that she is dating former co-star Liam Scholes, who played Eli Higginson in the show back in 2021. Coronation Street continues on Friday night on ITV at 8pm.
