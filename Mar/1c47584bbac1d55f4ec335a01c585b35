A village is up in arms over the future of a bright green hexagonal fence. Toby Garrett, 37, has been ordered to tear down his colourful creation outside his home in Sedbury, near Chepstow, in the Forest of Dean. He had failed to get permission for the fence and a nearby dome-shaped greenhouse. Despite no complaints from the local community, the artist has still been told to take down both structures as they ‘impact on visual amenity’. Toby said: ‘People on my street have sent me messages saying they are gutted because it cheers Sedbury up. ‘I phoned the council and was told art is not allowed without planning permission and I have to take it down within two weeks. ‘I make art to make people happy. I’m sorry it doesn’t make everyone smile.’ Toby’s greenhouse was even nicknamed the ‘Sedbury Gherkin’ due to its inspiration from the famous London landmark. The 37-year-old could apply for retrospective planning permission to save the structures, but fears it will be a lost cause. Meanwhile, hundreds of locals in the Forest of Dean have rallied behind Toby and supported the artist’s battle to save the fence and greenhouse. A petition against the planning decision has now amassed 400 signatures. It reads: ‘A local man toby who has done some amazing art sculptures in his garden, which all local residents love! ‘The council has now decided he has to take it all down. ‘Which has upset a lot of people as this man has spent all his time and effort to brighten the village up.’ A spokesman for Forest of Dean Council said it was investigating the planning dispute. He said: ‘Forest of Dean District Council is aware of the matter regarding a planning dispute at Buttington Road, Sedbury and the case is currently under investigation. ‘As the investigation is ongoing, we will not be making any further comment at this time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
