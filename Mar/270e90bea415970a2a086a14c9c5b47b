Three women and two men have all been missing since going on a night out on Friday. Fears are growing for Sophie Russon, Eve Smith, and Darcy Ross, all aged 20, who went out clubbing at the Muffler club in Newport, Wales. But their families have not heard from them since about 2am on Saturday, and are all ‘worried sick’. None of them have also been active on social media, and relatives have contacted the police to find them. Friends believe the three headed to Trecco Bay in Porthcawl with Shane Loughlin and Rafel Jeanne-Actie, who are also missing, Wales Online reported. Ms Smith’s sister Lauren Doyle said her car is still parked outside the Muffler club. In a post, she said: ‘It is known that they went to the Muffler in Maesglas and then went to Trecco Bay on Friday night. ‘But they left there to an unknown location during the night. They were last seen at approximately 2am. ‘None of them have made contact with friends or family, which is very unusual. We are all worried sick and thinking the worst.’ Ms Doyle further claimed her sister’s bag, which contained her car keys and bank card, is with their mum. ‘This means Eve has no access to funds or her vehicle,’ she added on Facebook. A relative of Mr Loughlin has also said he is missing, with his family working with the police to locate him. Loved ones of all five people have taken to social media to share pictures of them in a desperate plea for help. Metro.co.uk has contacted Gwent Police for a comment.
