A woman has died and two others have been seriously injured after multiple stabbings in Scotland. Police were called to a disturbance at a residential care home on Craighall Street, in Stirling, at 11am on Tuesday. Armed officers rushed inside the building as staff were seen fleeing the scene, a witness recalled. The 54-year-old carer was working when a vulnerable patient allegedly attacked her, the Sun reported. She was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow where she later died. Two other women, both believed to be carers, aged 29 and 58, were injured in the attack. A witness, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The lady who died was a carer. It was quite frightening. The other two injured were also carers. ‘One of them came out and one of them had towels wrapped around their arm. Police and ambulances came down, the police had their guns out.’ Police have now arrested a woman and have charged her in connection with the incident. The 32-year-old is scheduled to appear at Stirling Sheriff Court tomorrow. Detective Inspector Scott Roxburgh said: ‘At this time, our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased, along with everyone else involved in this incident. ‘We’d like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding as officers carry out enquiries in the area.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
