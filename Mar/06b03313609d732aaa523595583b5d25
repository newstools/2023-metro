Carla Connor (Alison King) is fearing for the future next week in Coronation Street as Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) takes legal action after his crash. Carla knocked Paul off Peter’s (Chris Gascoyne) motorbike a few weeks ago using the Underworld van – a vehicle that she wasn’t insured on. Because Paul is suffering with long-term injuries, he isn’t able to continue his usual work as a builder which means less money – something crucial for all of us during the cost of living crisis. When Doctor Gaddas told Paul that his hand could take up to 12 weeks to heal, Peter paid him a visit and offered £15k compensation. There was a catch to this deal, as Peter also wanted Paul to drop the case against Carla, adamant it would impact her mental health (something that only looks as though it’s deteriorating because Stephen is drugging her with LSD). At first, Paul accepted but on Dee-Dee’s (Channique Sterling-Brown) advice, he returned the cash and later, the lawyer told Carla that she has no choice but to sue her personally due to not being insured on the van. Next week, as Carla stresses about ending up back in prison, Peter promises her that it won’t happen. There could well be a glimmer of hope on the horizon for Carla as she then has an appointment with Doctor Gaddas and explains how each time she’s suffered an episode, it feels like she’s tripping on drugs. Prescribed with diazepam, is this enough to help Carla? Will she start to investigate further if she’s suspicious about being drugged? Or will the diazepam mixed with LSD just make everything worse?
