Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has been detained by police in Norway at a protest for indigenous rights. It is the second time the Swedish activist has been pictured being carried away by police in two months, after her appearance at a march against a coal mine’s expansion in Germany in January. Greta, holding a red, blue, yellow and green Sámi flag, was briefly detained following today’s protest in Oslo alongside other attendees, before all were released. The demonstrators were calling for the removal of wind turbines from reindeer pastures on land belonging to the Sámi, an indigenous group living in central and northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, as well as parts of Russia. Supporters say the transition to green energy should not come at the expense of Sámi rights. In 2021, Norway’s supreme court ruled that two wind farms at Fosen, near Trondheim, violated the indigenous people’s rights under international conventions. However, the turbines remain in operation 16 months later. Reindeer herders say the sight and sound of the giant machinery frighten their animals. In recent days, Greta joined protestors blocking access to some government buildings. The increased focus on the issue led the energy minister Terje Aasland decided to call off an official visit to the UK. In an interview with Reuters yesterday, Greta said: ‘Indigenous rights, human rights, must go hand-in-hand with climate protection and climate action. ‘That can’t happen at the expense of some people. Then it is not climate justice.’ The images of the 20-year-old being lifted by police echoed January’s protest at Luetzerath, near Dusseldorf. Demonstrators gathered at the abandoned German village to try and prevent the expansion of the Garzweiler coal mine by energy company RWE.
