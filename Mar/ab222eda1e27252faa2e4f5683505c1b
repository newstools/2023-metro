Dan Walker returned to hosting on Wednesday night for the first time since he was almost killed in a bike accident. The former BBC Breakfast star, 45, appeared to be in good spirits as he hosted the Royal Television Society Awards in London after he was struck by a car while cycling to work in the capital last week. Walker took the time to thank his make-up artist for ‘covering up the bruises’ ahead of the bash days after he shared photos of himself bloodied and bruised from the collision. He shared a photo of himself heading to London on the train and later another image of himself in a lift holding a tuxedo bag. Following the incident, Walker said he was ‘lucky to be alive’ but couldn’t remember the crash at all, sharing photos of himself in an ambulance. He’s been absent from his Channel 5 show ever since but hopes to return soon. Writing a piece in The Times about his hellish ordeal, Walker said he was ‘confident’ he’s not to blame for the accident. ‘I can’t really remember what they (the driver) looked like, from that moment they were looking over me as I came round, but I do recall that they looked deeply distressed and I imagine it is all they are thinking about at the moment,’ he said. Earlier this week he updated fans with a photo of himself with much less swelling and bruising. Alongside a picture of himself and his adorable dog Winnie, he told fans: ‘Face coming on nicely. Hopefully back in business soon. ‘Thanks for all your lovely messages.’ Got a story?
