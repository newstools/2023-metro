President Joe Biden had a skin lesion removed from his chest that was cancerous, the White House has revealed. The skin lesion was removed last month and was a basal cell carcinoma, which is a common type of skin cancer, White House doctor Kevin O’Connor said on Friday. Basal cells are one of the most common and treatable types of cancer, particularly when detected in the early stages. They grow in size but do not spread like other types of cancer, according to O’Connor. Biden’s chest area where the procedure was performed has ‘healed nicely’, O’Connor said. ‘No further treatment is required,’ he wrote, but Biden’s skin condition will be monitored. The procedure was done during Biden’s routine physical on February 16 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. It was performed just over a month after First Lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesion removed – one from her chest and another from her right eye. She also had a third lesion on her left eyelid that was being examined. Two of her lesions were found to be basal cell carcinoma. ‘All cancerous tissue was successfully removed,’ O’Connor said at the time. After the president’s physical, O’Connor said he is still a ‘healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency’. Biden’s health is under high scrutiny as he is expected to announce his bid for reelection in the weeks to come. The first lady a week ago said there was ‘pretty much’ nothing left for her husband to do except decide on a time and place to announce. ‘He says he’s not done. He’s not finished what he’s started,’ she said. ‘And that’s what’s important.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
