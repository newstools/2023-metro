A man died after he laid down on a stranger’s driveway after a boozy night out and was run over, an inquest has heard. Henry Rafferty was returning home on August 26 last year when he stopped on the drive in Hartlepool. The following morning, the homeowner got in his car and ran the 22-year-old over. After getting out of the car with his wife, the couple made the devastating discovery that Henry was under the vehicle. Henry’s dad, Colin Rafferty, said the whole family has been left in ‘unbearable pain’ since the accident. He said: ‘We can’t believe it’s happened. We all cry every day. It’s just so bad, the pain is unbearable. ‘There were hundreds of people at his funeral. There are hundreds who love him so dearly.’ A post mortem found the young transport manager died as a result of torso injuries. A toxicology report also found he had alcohol in his system to the equivalent of around three times the drink drive limit. Cleveland Police found there were no suspicious circumstances and assistant coroner Karin Welsh described Henry’s death as a ‘tragic accident’. ‘He had been out socialising. It looks as if he was making his way back home,’ said Ms Welsh. ‘For some reason, whether he had fallen or lay down, he was on the driveway of a property in Elwick Road, Hartlepool. ‘It was a driveway that led to the rear of a property. It appears that it was not well lit. On this particular evening it appears the gentleman was returning home. He stopped and turned onto the driveway.’ Ms Welsh added: ‘He had all of his life ahead of him and sadly that has been taken away. It’s a heartbreaking reminder to all of us of the preciousness of life.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
