An inquest has been opened into the death of transgender teenager Brianna Ghey, with a police officer saying members of the public found her unresponsive. Brianna was 16 when she was found with fatal stab wounds in a Warrington park on February 11. A boy and a girl, both aged 15, have been charged with her murder and are due to go on trial at Liverpool Crown Court on July 10. Neither accused can be named because of their age. At a brief two-minute hearing at Warrington Coroner’s Court, Jacqueline Devonish, senior coroner for Cheshire, opened and adjourned the inquest into Brianna’s death until after the trial. She set a date for a pre-inquest hearing on August 17. Detective Inspector Nigel Parr, the senior investigating officer for the incident from Cheshire Police said: ‘The investigation is a murder investigation and two individuals have been charged with the murder of Brianna.’ He confirmed the teenager was found ‘unresponsive’ by members of the public in the park and paramedics attended and confirmed the date of death. A post-mortem examination was carried out at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, results of which were given at the hearing on Tuesday. Candle vigils for Brianna were held across the country on Valentine’s Day last month, featuring trans flags and signs calling for greater protections. A GoFundMe page for her family has raised more than £110,000 in less than a month. The teenager’s funeral will be held in Warrington on March 15. Got a story?
