Yellow weather warnings have now been put in place for London as well as other parts of the UK. Snow and ice are expected in the capital following an Arctic blast which could cause chaos for commuters. The Met Office has issued a weather warning from 9pm tonight until 10am tomorrow. Today is set to be the coldest day of the year with snow and ice expected to hit parts of the north including Scotland. An arctic blast will mean up to 20cm (4in) of snow could fall on high ground, with up to 10cm possible in low-lying regions, according to forecasters. It will feel as cold as -4C in parts of the UK as a front of cold air works its way down the country, bringing the threat of sleet and snow in the Midlands and southern England later in the week. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice in parts of Scotland and northern England as temperatures are set to plummet. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a cold weather alert and placed north-west England and Yorkshire under a level 3 alert. This means there is a 90% chance of severely cold weather, icy conditions or heavy snow, which could increase the health risk to vulnerable people. The rest of the UK has been placed under level 2. The forecaster has already warned of the risk of travel disruption in areas affected by snow with roads and railways expected to be icy.
