An eight-year-old boy has been deemed a hero after rescuing his cousin from drowning. The brave act was filmed on a security camera at the boy’s family home in the municipality of Mongagua in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, on February 25. Adults in the clip, along with a child in the pool, seem unaware the toddler had plunged into the water. But rescue eventually comes in the form of the youngster’s brave cousin – Bernardo. Without hesitating, the eight-year-old plunged into the garden’s swimming pool when he saw his young relative was in danger. His mum, Renata Cristina Rios, believes her son’s quick-thinking actions came as a result of surfing classes he had taken in Mongagua. Bernardo has been going to free classes given by Surf Escola since 2021. The project is a partnership between the NGO Esporte Vida and the Maritime Fire Department. Renata says it was there that Bernardo became a stronger swimmer, learned to surf, and studied the basics of first aid for accidents in water. She told local media: ‘The preparation regarding first aid allowed him to have a quick thought process when jumping in and saving the child.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
