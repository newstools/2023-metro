Casemiro will serve a four-game suspension after he was sent off in Manchester United’s Premier League clash with Southampton on Sunday. The Brazil international was dismissed in the first half at Old Trafford for his challenge on Carlos Alcaraz. Referee Anthony Taylor initially gave Casemiro a yellow card but after reviewing the incident on the VAR monitor, he upgraded it to a red. Casemiro has already been sent off in the Premier League this season as he was dismissed in the 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on February 4. That means the 31-year-old, who has been instrumental in United’s midfield following his arrival from Real Madrid, will be given a three-game suspension and will sit out a further match because of his previous red card. Casemiro will now miss United’s FA Cup tie at home to Fulham on March 19. He will also be unavailable for United’s Premier League fixtures against Newcastle United, Brentford and Everton. The midfielder will be in line to return for United’s Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest on April 15. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
