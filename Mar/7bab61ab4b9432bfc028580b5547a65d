Often it’s the little things that can brighten our day. In fact, a new study – carried out by Tesco – has revealed some of the everyday thrills that make us smile. Topping the list is finding money in a pocket (35%) – something that’s clearly very much welcome during the current cost of living crisis. Other ‘small wins’ involving money also feature on the list, with noticing a favourite product is on special offer (27%) making an appearance, as well as getting a surprise bonus or tip (24%). Also, getting a free upgrade on a flight or hotel was also picked by a quarter of those surveyed. Money-aside, the sun shining when you wake up in the morning was the second favourite overall. Elsewhere, some of the nation’s other everyday thrills to make it into the top 10 include snuggling into a bed with fresh sheets (34%), receiving an unexpected gift (33%), and being told ‘I love you’ (25%). Tesco collated 50 of these ‘little thrills’ in total, with finding a parking space, finishing work early, and having a good hair day also making it onto the list. The data also revealed that UK adults experience three of these everyday thrills every week on average – which adds up to 156 over the course of a year. And the boost from these wins make us feel better for around 11 minutes. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
