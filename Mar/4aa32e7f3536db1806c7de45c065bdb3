Erik ten Hag has ‘no plans’ to strip Bruno Fernandes of the armband after calls for the midfielder to have the captaincy removed following his display against Liverpool. Fernandes has had the armband for most of the season, what with Harry Maguire’s continued absence from the side. But the Portuguese midfielder displayed very little of the leadership skills that got him the armband against Liverpool on Sunday. Fernandes pushed the assistant referee, held his face after being caught in the chest by Ibrahima Konate and gestured to come off the field after Liverpool scored their sixth. Gary Neville labelled his actions a ‘disgrace’ following the match, while Roy Keane said United’s players will feel that Fernandes let them down. There have been calls for Fernandes to therefore have the captaincy removed and Ten Hag has shown already this season that he’s willing to be ruthless. But the Sun say Ten Hag has no plans to take the armband off Fernandes and the midfielder still retains his faith. Fernandes is said to have spoken to his team-mates after the defeat, telling them they must make amends in the remainder of the season. United have little time to dwell on the defeat as they face Real Betis at Old Trafford on Thursday. They then get their Premier League campaign back on track with a home game against Southampton.
