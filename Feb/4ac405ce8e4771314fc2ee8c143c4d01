It’s been all change for Rachel Stevens, as the singer has started a new chapter in her life, following her split from her husband. The S Club 7 star announced in July last year that she and Alex Bourne had parted ways, one month before their 13th anniversary. Rachel, 44, said it had been a ‘difficult decision’ to make, but assured that she and Alex, 45, would remain ‘partners in parenthood’ for their two daughters. The former Dancing On Ice star shares Amelie, 12, and Minnie, eight, with the actor, and they have continued to ‘love and respect’ one another after ending their marriage. Now, six months on from sharing the news, Rachel has moved out of their family home. Sharing a selfie to Instagram, the pop star gave her 321k followers an update, as she looks forward to a ‘new beginning’. ‘Hey all. Hope you’re really well. What a week it’s been… sorry I’ve been MIA,’ Rachel began in her caption. ‘I’ve just moved home today and I’m up to my ears in boxes and feeling such a mix of emotions.’ Expressing her gratitude for her family and friends, she added: ‘I’m so incredibly grateful for the love and support I have around me🙏🏻’ Rachel concluded: ‘Trusting the process and the magic of new beginnings ✨💫’ The star was met with a whole load of support in the comments, with bandmate Jo O’Meara leaving three red heart emoji. ‘My beautiful bestie, there is so much magic to come, you wait and see. You’ve got this, love you 💫💫💫’, wrote one friend sweetly. ‘Sending love to you and your girls in your new home ❤️’, penned another. Rachel and Alex tied the knot in 2009 at Claridge’s in London. They were childhood sweethearts who reconnected later in life and went on to build a family. Rachel previously revealed on Roxie Nafousi’s The Moments That Made Me podcast: ‘We were childhood sweethearts. We went out with each other when we were 12, we met at youth club and I was besotted with him! ‘We went out for probably about four weeks and when you’re that age that was a really long time!’ She added: ‘We then went on dates again when we were like 16 and then again when we were 18 and then we parted ways, you know, obviously I went off and did my thing he went off and did his thing. ‘Years and years later, I was in Selfridges randomly and he walked in and we bumped into each other. We were both in our late 20s and weirdly he said as he was walking in, “I know I’m going to see you,” he knew he was going to see me…’ Alas, their romance wasn’t to last forever, although it seems Rachel is picking herself back up, having also reportedly landed a radio gig. It was reported in August that the pint-sized TV star was set for a career change, having bagged a presenting job on Heart Radio as a DJ, in a career switch-up. Got a story?
