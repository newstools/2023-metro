A decapitated head and several other body parts were found in a park in Paris. A police investigation was launched after the victim’s pelvis was the first body part to be discovered by gardeners working at the park yesterday, local media reports. Officers searched Buttes-Chaumont park around 11am on Valentine’s Day and discovered several other body parts, belonging to a woman, in plastic bags. Investigators continue to comb the 25 hectares of the park and the surrounding streets, which are currently cordoned off. A diving team is also searching the lake in the park. The Buttes-Chaumont Park is in the north-east of the French capital and is one of the area’s biggest green spaces, being popular with families and runners. The body parts are thought to have been discovered near a disused railway line, although this is not yet confirmed. The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed to local media outlet BFMTV this morning the discovery of the remains, but provided little other information. An autopsy of the pelvis was carried out around 10.45am today, but the results of this have not yet been released. A source told local publication Le Parisien: ‘Obviously, the body was cut dressed. The corpse was not in a state of putrefaction, which seems to attest to a recent death.’ Police have not yet revealed the identity of the woman and the circumstances surrounding her death are not yet clear. Le Parisien reported she was dressed in blue jeans emblazoned with a flower over the thigh, possibly of North African or European descent.
