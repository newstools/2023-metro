Manchester United look set to be without Anthony Martial, Harry Maguire and Antony for Thursday’s Europa League second leg play-off clash against Barcelona. The Red Devils played out an entertaining 2-2 draw with the Catalans at the Camp Nou last Thursday and must beat the Spanish side at Old Trafford to progress to the last-16 of the competition. United continue to fight on four fronts, with the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle United to be played less than 72 hours after their clash against Barcelona. That’s stretched Erik ten Hag’s squad, particularly after long-term injuries to Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek. But there’s unlikely to be any good news in the short-term, with Martial, Maguire and Antony still absent from training ahead of Thursday’s game. Martial and Antony had both started light, individual training last week but they’re yet to reintegrate into first team training. Casemiro is available after serving the third of a three-match suspension against Leicester City on Sunday. Marcel Sabitzer and Lisandro Martinez both missed the first leg through suspension but are available again for selection. Raphael Varane is also expected to return to their starting line-up, having remained on the bench for Sunday’s win against the Foxes.
