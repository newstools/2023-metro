A man has been arrested after four Grindr users were drugged and burgled during dates. Metropolitan Police officers have detained a 29-year-old man at Gatwick Airport on Thursday, on suspicion of aggravated assault. He was taken to a south London police station, where he is being held in custody. Detectives said there have been four reported burglaries, in which two suspects administered ‘a noxious substance’ to drug their victims unconscious. All woke up later to find several of their personal belongings missing, including valuables. The incidents happened in Brentford and Hounslow, in west London, Hampton, in south-west London, and Bromley, in south-east London, between New Year’s Eve and January 9. The four male victims are aged between 32 and 55, and all did not suffer lasting effects from the drugs. In January, police identified the two suspects as a large black man and a slimmer white man who both spoke Spanish. It is understood the arrested suspect is one of these men. Meanwhile, the second remains at large. The Met issued an appeal in January for more victims who have fallen prey to the pair to come forward.
