When workers in the arts or charities are striking, something is amiss in the UK. February has already seen an estimated 500,000 people across public and private sectors taking to the picket line over pay and conditions, and there is little sign of them backing down. Union leaders are announcing new strike dates weekly, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) expected to announce the first continuous 48-hour action, seen as an escalation in its pay dispute with the government. So, who is on strike today and how will this affect you? Staff at the Department for Work and Pensions are starting the week at the picket lines, Workers in Liverpool – at Toxteth Jobcentre, Duke Street Jobcentre, Liverpool City Jobcentre and Liverpool Innovation Park Jobcentre – are all walking out. Those at Stockport Contact Centre and Bolton Benefit Centre are following suit. It comes after the government announced plans last year to shut more than 40 DWP offices, with the Toxteth Jobcentre location earmarked for closure. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) say the action is a ‘response to the lack of movement from the government on their demands on pay, pensions and job security’. DVLA members working in the output services Group at Ty Felin and Morriston, in Swansea, are taking part of today’s strikes. It is part of national industrial action by the PCS union over pay, pensions, jobs and redundancy terms. The strike will last five days, ending on Friday, after beginning in November 2022. Staff at the British Museum in London will be on the picket line for seven days, starting today. Public access to the tourist attraction will be disrupted as more than 100 security and visitor services workers finally down tools. The strike is happening during half-term when many families may be heading to the museum. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
