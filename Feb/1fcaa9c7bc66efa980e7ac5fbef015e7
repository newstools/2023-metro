Overburdened NHS staff told a watchdog they often worried ‘how many people are we going to kill today?’ amid severe delays in urgent care. And many ‘cried or displayed other extreme emotion’ as they recounted hearing 999 callers’ conditions deteriorate while waiting for ambulances, the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) reports. Its survey of call handlers, paramedics and A&E staff was meant to focus on what had worked well during the NHS’s winter crisis. But this quickly changed ‘as the investigation saw, felt and heard the significant distress’ of staff. The HSIB added more than 100 category 2 calls – relating to conditions such as a heart attack and stroke – were waiting ‘with no ambulances available to respond’. And A&E workers told of making ‘challenging decisions’ on which patients in queuing ambulances to take in for treatment. They said this often meant choosing ‘the most unwell, unwell patient’, which left them distressed as they wanted to do the right thing by everyone. Many workers said ‘the burden of moral distress’ placed upon them made it difficult to switch off from work. Others ‘spoke of isolation and despair at going home to an empty house after a challenging day, without support structures in place’, the report added. It concluded: ‘While staff are trying their very best to ensure safe care, harm is happening and affecting patient outcomes and staff wellbeing.’ Data also showed stress and depression is the most reported reason for staff sickness, accounting for more than 476,900 full-time equivalent days lost. An NHS spokesperson said: ‘There is no doubt staff faced significant challenges this winter. We take staff wellbeing incredibly seriously.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
