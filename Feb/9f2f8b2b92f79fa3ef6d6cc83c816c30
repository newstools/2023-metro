Two adorable little dogs are searching for a new home after their owners abandoned them without food and water when they went on holiday. Helping Yorkshire Poundies (HYPS), a dog rescue charity in South Yorkshire, is currently taking care of the Chihuahuas, Toby and Chloe, after the siblings’ plight was discovered by local police. The charity said the dog’s owners did not want their pets returned to them after coming back from their holiday. In a Facebook post introducing the two dogs, HYPS said: ‘Hi everyone I’m Toby the Chihuahua and I’m here with my sister, Chloe. ‘You won’t believe what we’ve been through. We were rescued by the police after we were left to fend for ourselves in the house when my owners went on holiday and didn’t want us back. ‘We couldn’t believe it…our little legs can’t find food or water for ourselves – it was horrible being alone and hungry. ‘So, We’ve come to HYPS to find better people people who would never dream of abandoning us! We’re pretty sure we deserve that, don’t you?! ‘Me and Chloe get on OK, but she gets fed up of me sometimes, so today I had my little boys op (apparently we can’t risk us having any pesky little babies of our own!) so I’m feeling extra sorry for myself tonight, but I’ll be OK!!’ Based in Rotheram, HYPS is a small, volunteer-run charity who seek to take of and rehome ‘dogs on death row’ To learn more about the adoption process and what you can do to help Toby and Chloe, visit the Helping Yorkshire Poundies website here.
