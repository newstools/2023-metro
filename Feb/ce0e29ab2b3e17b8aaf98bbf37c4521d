Passengers on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) will be greeted by a different voice when new trains are rolled out over the next couple of years. The DLR connects parts of east London to the likes of City Airport and Canary Wharf. And people will soon get their journeys upgraded when a new fleet of DLR cars come to the network. But one of the key differences riders will notice is a change to on-board announcements. Gone will be the recognisable female voice over and in its place will be automatic text-to-speech software. The ‘Mind the Gap’ announcements made at Greenwich, Island Gardens and Canary Wharf stations to name a few are currently made by a male voice over artist – and this too will change to synthesised speech. The trains will look a bit different on the outside too, with the red, black and blue colour scheme being replaced by white and turquoise. Inside, passengers will see more fold-up seats which will help increase capacity by an estimated 30%. Luckily, the ‘drivers seats’ at the front of the train which passengers love will be staying in place. Not only will there be more space inside, but there will also be more frequent services too. When completed, 43 new trains will be replacing 33 of the oldest DLR trains, meaning there will be an extra 10 on the network. The new programme will also bring an expansion of DLR’s main depot at Beckton, with an extension of maintenance facilities for the latest design of trains. You will have to wait for a little while to see them as they’re set to be rolled out sometime in 2024 before being on the whole network by 2026.
