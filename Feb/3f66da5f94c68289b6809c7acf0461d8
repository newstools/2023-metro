Stacey Solomon fans are convinced they’ve worked out the name of her baby. While the Loose Women star was getting crafty ahead of the arrival of her little girl, which is apparently imminent, eagle-eyed fans spotted a theme in her creations they reckon spells out the incoming baby’s name. The 33-year-old took to Instagram with a video of her ‘patiently waiting’ to give birth as she created a hanging basket for the new addition to the family, who she is expecting with EastEnders actor husband Joe Swash, 41. Captioning the video, which showed a teddy chilling in the X Factor star’s cute basket, she said: ‘From mummy with love little one… ☁️ Patiently waiting for you to be here, we are all so excited to finally meet you baby girl… ‘She’s very comfy apparently, letting me know who’s boss already 😂 Now just need to find a safe out of reach 😂 little cubby hole to put this in.’ But it wasn’t Stacey’s words fans leapt on – it was her choice of decoration: pearls. One fan wrote: ‘Baby Pearl. Just a suggestion ❤️’ while another guessed, ‘By any chance are you going to call her Pearl 🥰 ??’ Another said: ‘Is this a clue to her name? Pearl 🥰’ Whether fans are right or not remains to be seen, but we are sure to find out soon as Stacey revealed a few days ago she is due ‘any day’ now – so watch this space. The name Pearl certainly would strike a similar chord as her other daughter’s name, one-year-old Rose Solomon-Swash. Stacey is also mum to three boys, 14-year-old Zachary who she shares with ex Dean Cox, her and Aaron Barham’s 10-year-old Leighton, and three-year-old Rex, who was her and current partner Joe’s first child. Joe also has a 15-year-old son called Harry, who he shares with former partner Emma Sophocleous. When Stacey announced she was expecting her fifth child, the star said: ‘So grateful & can not believe I’m saying this… Another little pickle is on the way… A HUGE surprise, but one that we are so thankful for to the moon & back bub.’ She wrote of her surprise alongside a very cute video of her surprising Joe with a pregnancy test, to which he responded: ‘You’re joking! This is the best news bubba.’ The pair only found out they were going to be having another baby quite late in her pregnancy, and the announcement didn’t come until December after they took a ‘few months’ to enjoy the moment privately. The star joked that for a while she just looked like she’d ‘had a big lunch’ and was caught unawares by the happy revelation. Got a story?
