Shoppers at a packed Ikea in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, were ordered to ‘leave immediately’ in an apparent ‘lockdown’ this evening. Social media posts from around 7:15pm show rafts of customers outside of the Swedish furniture store on Wellington Road after being guided out. One witness told the Manchester Evening News that the store is still ‘locked down’ after staff told them over the tannoy to leave. ‘We were already leaving as the announcement started and the security guy came running down the stairs and seemed so panicked telling us to leave immediately,’ they said. ‘The announcement said any children in the play area had already been evacuated and staff would help people find their kids.’ One witness, mental health activist John Junior, tweeted: ‘Mad panic at @IKEAUK tonight in Ashton under Lyne! ‘Being evacuated and store is locked down. They are not saying anything to us. Terrible.’ He added: ‘Got evacuated as we was about to eat and try the meatballs at Ikea in Ashton Under Lyne and we are all outside with so many other people. ‘Alarms going off and speaker system telling us to leave the building.’ People reported hearing alarms as made their way through the Ikea towards the car park exit. Customers have since been allowed back inside to the store. The nature of the incident and why customers had to be cleared out has yet to be confirmed, though Fire and Rescue Services are not at the scene. Metro.co.uk contacted Ikea for comment.
