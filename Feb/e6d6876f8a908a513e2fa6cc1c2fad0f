A former PC has admitted sex offences against a vulnerable 13-year-old girl. Haider Siddique, 22, was arrested after a bus driver saw him acting inappropriately towards the victim last March, while on long-term sick leave. Siddique – who joined West Midlands Police as a student officer in August 2021 and was never used in an operational role – admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child at Birmingham crown court yesterday. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of child abduction, which was allowed to lie on file. Adjourning sentencing until March 3, Judge Tom Rochford said harm he caused was ‘in the most serious category’. Dep Ch Con Vanessa Jardine called it ‘a sickening criminal act’. A Met Police integrity hotline has had dozens of calls a week, with a third related to other forces.
