The ocean is full to the brim of creepy creatures – in case you needed reminded. Sausage-shaped ‘penis fish’ baffled Americans when they washed onto shore in 2019. An aquatic animal dubbed a ‘cheeseburger with teeth’ terrified us all when it was found two years later. Now, Australia’s Choriaster Granulatus starfish has been given its chance to shine on the Internet. The pale pink creature has a series of ‘arms’ each with its very own bulbous tip. After a Reddit user posted a picture of the starfish, it soon racked up thousands of likes and comments. It was swiftly renamed ‘Cocktopus’ and ‘Pornstar’ by those who couldn’t contain their glee at the strange sight. One user quipped: ‘Looks like I’m going on a trip to Australia!’ Another added: ‘My wife keeps one of these in her bedside table, they buzz at night sometimes.’ The Choriaster Granulatus is commonly found in Australia as well as waters in East Africa, the Indo-Pacific region Red Sea, Vanuatu, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. It can live as deep as 40 meters below the surface of the ocean. This species is harmless to humans – so you’re welcome to touch the starfish if you ever come across it.
