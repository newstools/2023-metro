A woman who lives two miles away from Grenfell Tower has appeared in court accused of fraudulently claiming support for survivors of the 2017 fire. Salma Said, 48, from Kensington, allegedly pretended to have lost her home in the devastating blaze as part of a string of false claims which netted her more than £389,000. Prosecutors say her story was backed up by two other people, 35-year-old Rawda Said and 38-year-old Makrem Harzi, both also from Kensington, who appeared alongside her charged with assisting an offender. Salma Said is also accused of making a dishonest claim through the Right to Buy housing scheme in Barnet in September 2017, three months after the fire which killed 72 people. She is charged with six counts of fraud by false representation said to have been committed between 2014 and 2018. The three defendants appeared in Westminster Magistrates’ Court with two others accused of playing parts in the alleged offending. Nura Abdulkader, 40, from Hackney, is accused lying about living in Grenfell on 14 June 2017 in order to gain ‘housing and financial support’. William Inglebright, 62, from Hammersmith, is accused of dishonestly claiming to meet the relevant criteria for the Help to Buy scheme in Barnet in May 2017 in order to be granted an equity loan. All five defendants indicated they would plead not guilty to all offences. All five were released on bail ahead of a further hearing at Isleworth Crown Court.
