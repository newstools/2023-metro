A teenage girl stabbed to death in a park has been named as Brianna Ghey. Emergency services were called to Linear Park in Culcheth, Warrington, at around 3.13pm yesterday after Brianna’s body was found on a path. She was pronounced dead at the scene, Cheshire Police said. The teenager suffered multiple stab wounds and a post-mortem examination will now take place to establish her cause of death. Police are now appealing to speak to a man and a woman who were seen in the park where the teenager’s body was found. Anyone who may have seen Brianna in the hours before her death has also been asked to contact the police to help them with their investigation. Detective Chief Supt Mike Evans said: ‘This is a truly awful attack on a 16-year-old girl, who has sadly lost her very short life. ‘We are appealing for any information that will help us find who has done this to Brianna. ‘In particular we are keen to speak to two people that were seen in the park where Brianna’s body was found who have been described as a white man and woman, in their late teens/early twenties, both with dark curly hair. ‘The man was wearing a longish dark hooded coat and the woman had a distinctive red or purple black checked blanket-style coat and a long flowing skirt, dress or trousers. ‘We are also keen to speak to anyone who was in the park from around 1.30pm until 4.00pm yesterday or anyone who may have seen Brianna in the hours leading up to her death. ‘We would ask people and businesses within the local community to check any CCTV or dashcam footage for anything that may aid our investigation. ‘I would like to reassure the local community that we are working hard to find those responsible for Brianna’s death and we have extra officers in and around Culcheth supporting the investigation. We also have officers supporting Brianna’s family at this really tragic time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
