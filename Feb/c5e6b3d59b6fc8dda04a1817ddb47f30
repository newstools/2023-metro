Saving Private Ryan actor Tom Sizemore is in a critical condition at a Los Angeles hospital. The 61-year-old star suffered a brain aneurysm at his home at 2am on Saturday. His manager, Charles Lago, has said that someone found the movie star unconscious, then called 911. Emergency services then transported Sizemore to a local hospital, where he was taken into intensive care. Lago told Fox News: ‘He is in the hospital. ‘His family is aware of the situation and are hoping for the best.’ ‘It is too early to know about [a] recovery situation as he is in critical condition under observation,’ he confirmed. TMZ first broke the news of Sizemore’s hospitalisation, reporting that he was in a ‘bad way’, while chances of a full recovery were uncertain. The Hollywood star is best known for playing Mike Horvath in 1998 war action film Saving Private Ryan, starring alongside Tom Hanks and Matt Damon. Saving Private Ryan is set after the Normandy Landings and follows a group of US soldiers as they go behind enemy lines to retrieve a paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in action. As well as the popular WWII flick, Sizemore also starred in Black Hawk Down, Natural Born Killers, and Heat. His latest project is set to be indie sci-fi film Impuratus, in which he plays a detective who is forced to believe in the supernatural after witnessing a Civil War veteran’s death bed confession. Speaking to Age of the Nerd about his lengthy career, he said previously: ‘I’ve always loved movies. ‘That’s why I started doing this, and after all these years I still adore movies.’ Given how the industry has changed over the years, he also noted how it’s important to still have ‘a real passion for stories.’ However, he’s also had a tumultuous personal life, having previously been arrested for domestic violence, possession of a controlled substance, and for driving under the influence.
