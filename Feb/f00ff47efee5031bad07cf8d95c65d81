Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has provided an injury update on three Gunners stars, including Emile Smith Rowe. Smith Rowe has missed the majority of the 2022-23 campaign through a groin injury and underwent surgery earlier this season. The 22-year-old England international has featured just six times this term across all competitions. Smith Rowe made a brief return in January following his surgery – featuring for 15 minutes in the FA Cup win over League One side Oxford United – and coming on as a late substitute in the 2-0 victory over Tottenham in the north London derby. But he suffered an injury setback and missed the FA Cup defeat to Manchester City and Premier League loss to Everton after picking up a thigh problem. Ahead of Arsenal’s clash against Brentford at the Emirates on Saturday, Arteta gave an update on Smith Rowe as well as Gabriel Jesus and Reiss Nelson. ‘The ones that they were long time like Emile, Reiss and Gabi they are closer,’ Arteta said as he looks to get the league leaders back to winning ways. ‘They started to do some work outside but they are not ready to contribute yet.’ Jesus, who moved to north London from Manchester City in the summer, has not featured for the Gunners since picking up a knee injury at the World Cup in Qatar. ‘Gabi’s doing really well,’ Arteta added. ‘He’s already been outside a little bit. ‘It’s still early stages and he keeps pushing everybody every single day but we need to respect timelines and processes but he’s doing really well. ‘He’s still too far from that [a timeline]. You see now when you put loads through that knee and get some movement and actions, they’re not as controlled as the ones he has been doing [before]. ‘[You have to see] how the knee reacts and whether he’s comfortable to move to the next stage.’ MORE : William Gallas reveals Mikel Arteta team talk ahead of Arsenal vs Brentford MORE : Kyle Walker warns Arsenal over ‘twists and turns’ in Premier League title race
