Bafta co-host Alison Hammond teased she might make the jump from the small to the silver screen. In an exclusive catch-up with Guilty Pleasures, the This Morning favourite said she wouldn’t rule out a move to movies. ‘What’s so amazing is, I actually started out in film,’ Alison, 48, divulged. ‘It was called Artemis 81, when I was six years old. My Mum got me in the movie, (which starred) Sting. ‘Who knows, in the future, maybe I will be going off to do film.’ Last night, the mum-of-one was on hand to get all the gossip at the access-all-areas Bafta Studio. And having interviewed everyone from Beyoncé to Harrison Ford, she no longer gets nervous around A-listers. ‘I still get starstruck. But once I say hello to them, it fades away and I realise it’s just a normal person who is like me, wants to laugh,’ she smiled. Alison is truly reaching for the stars as she recently revealed her hopes to land her own chat show – and let’s face it, she would be brilliant at it. She previously told Guilty Pleasures: ‘There isn’t any. Do you know what, we need to put it on the vision board, definitely. I’m open to a chat show, without a doubt. It would be a wonderful thing for the nation.’ The presenter added: ‘Listen, if I don’t host it, they’ve missed a trick, let’s be honest. But I haven’t been asked, no – fuming!’ she quipped. ‘Heigh-ho, that’s life. If they can’t see the magic that I would bring to that Big Brother situation, then what can I say?’ Got a story?
