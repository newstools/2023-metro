McDonald’s has said it will remove a ‘tasetless’ poster put up opposite a crematorium in Cornwall. Many chuckled at the advert – for the fast-food giant’s McCrispy burger – which stands next to the entrance to Penmount Crematorium, near Truro. But others were less impressed. ‘Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless’, said one woman, whose mother-in-law was cremated there last year. ‘I’m sure some grieving family members won’t like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one.’ Others commenting online greeted the story with a mixture of bafflement and mockery. ‘I will be cremated when I’m gone and I think it’s hilarious’, wrote one person. ‘It never ceases to amaze me what trivial things cause some people to get so upset. ‘Before this publicity, there probably weren’t that many people who’d even noticed it.’ ‘It’s lunchtime and I’m off to McDonald’s,’ they added. Jokes that the bus stop sign will be replaced by a poster advertising Burger King’s flame-grilled Whopper have also circulated online. Local press CornwallLive first pointed out the unfortunate advert placement on the busy A39 between Truro and Carland Cross. When their reporter asked locals what they thought of the sign, one said: ‘I think how funny it is will probably depend on how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie.’ Cornwall Council, which runs the crematorium and owns the bus shelter, did not comment on the issue. McDonald’s said it was taking the matter very seriously. ‘We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop,’ said a spokesperson. ‘However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed’.
