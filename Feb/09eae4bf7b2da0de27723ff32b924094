A man who has been collecting rare trading and Pokemon cards since the 1990s will sell them off for a whopping £250,000. Gordon White started the hobby when his children asked to join a Pokemon league 16 years ago. The 58-year-old has since cashed in by selling half the collection for a massive £200,000 last November. The dad from Livingston, Scotland, is set to make an additional £60,000 for selling off his treasure trove’ of Magic: The Gathering cards. He said: ‘For me, the fun is the completing, not the collecting and as far as I’m concerned, I’ve completed it so it’s time to pass it all on.’ Gordon has been involved with the cards industry as a judge in UK events while ‘mixing with the highest echelons in the Pokémon world.’ The collection will be sold by Richard Winterton Auctioneers in Lichfield, Staffordshire, in an online auction which began yesterday (Friday). Auctioneer Richard Winterton said Magic: The Gathering cards would be highly sought after by collectors because it was a ‘landmark’. ‘Magic is the first trading card of its type where you collected cards and then sent them off to do battle,’ he said. ‘Wizards Of The Coast became a big name from Magic: The Gathering. ‘It was after Magic that Wizards Of The Coast got the licence to do Pokémon for the west. ‘This is the first time we’ve had full sets of Magic: The Gathering. ‘A collection of this magnitude does not come up for auction very often. ‘Gordon initially chose to sell his collection through us as he saw how we had marketed other important Pokémon collections and the team has been painstaking in their attention to detail cataloguing these incredible cards.’ Other items up for grabs include Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon items worth between £3,000 to £10,000. There will also be cards from VS System Marvel and DC, Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter from the early 2000s. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
