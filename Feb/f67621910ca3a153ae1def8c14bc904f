Looking to spice things up this Valentine’s Day? Well, maybe ‘The Lasagne’ should be on the menu. This sex position, also known as The Flat Iron, is like doggy with a twist. It’s great for couples who want to enjoy sex from behind with extra intimacy. It involves the penetrated person lying on their front on the bed. They can either lie flat or prop themselves up on their elbows. They might also want to try putting a pillow under their pelvis to help things go a bit deeper. Then, the penetrator lies on top of the other person, with all or most of their bodies touching – just like layers of a lasagne. Think spooning, just from a different angle. The Lasagne will be just the thing for couples who enjoy doggy style with a side of cuddling. The penetrator could also hold their partner’s wrists down on the bed to make things even spicier. Doggy style fans might also be interested in trying ‘The Leapfrog’ sex position. For that one, the penetratee gets on their hands and knees and leans the top half of their body forward, keeping their behind in the air. Do you have a story to share?
