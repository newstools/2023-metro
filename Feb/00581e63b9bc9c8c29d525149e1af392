After training for weeks and months to reach the point of his victory in the ring against Jake Paul, it’s time for Tommy Fury to enjoy some well-deserved treats. After winning the highly-anticipated and highly-lucrative fight by split decision in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, the 23-year-old was excited to return home to his girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague, also 23, and their newborn daughter Bambi. The boxer had a gold-adorned welcome waiting for him at their house, before he and Molly-Mae headed out for a meal. In a new picture posted on Instagram, Tommy can be seen tucking into a delicious-looking burger and chips with a bandage on his left eyebrow, as he recovers from the violent bout. In the post shared by Molly-Mae, she wrote: ‘DADDYS HOME🏆🥊🤍👼🏼✨From day 1 of this fight being mentioned two and a half years ago, I backed this boy. ‘It definitely wasn’t a straight or easy road, we had some seriously not so good days behind closed doors… but Sunday night made it all worth it. The good guy doesn’t always finish last, I am so proud of you❤.’ As well as the photo of Tommy enjoying his burger, Molly-Mae also uploaded an adorable black-and-white image of their family on the sofa, alongside the fighter’s victory belt. In the second picture, Molly-Mae held Bambi aloft in front of a side that read: ‘Welcome Home Champ. We are so proud of you’ in gold lettering, alongside gold and white balloons. Having spoken out about heading straight back into training after his daughter’s birth in January, Tommy was also shown holding her with an adoring smile on his face After beating Jake in the fight – with both of them expressing their desire for a rematch – Tommy dedicated his win to Molly-Mae and Bambi with tears streaming down his face. ‘For the past two and a half years, this is all that’s consumed my life. Broke rib, denied access, and everybody thought I was running scared. Tonight, I made my own legacy. I am Tommy Fury,’ he said. He then added: ‘I want to dedicate this fight to my new baby girl Bambi at home and my Mrs, I love you. I can’t wait to see you. This fight was for you. It’s for you Bambi, I love you.’ Got a story?
