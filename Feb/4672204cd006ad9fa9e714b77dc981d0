The leader of Chechnya has said he dreams of creating his own mercenary army, after being impressed by the work of the notorious Wagner Group in Ukraine. Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Vladimir Putin, said he wanted to turn to the private military industry once his time as premier comes to an end. The Wagner Group, which is run by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, consists of around 50,000 soldiers largely recruited from Russian prisons. It has played a decisive role in the war in Ukraine, working alongside the Russian army but separately from the formal military command. Kadyrov, 46, also leads a mostly autonomous force in Ukraine, with several Chechen units participating in the fighting. He wrote in a post on Telegram: ‘We can say confidently that Wagner has shown its mettle in military terms and drawn a line under discussions about whether or not such private military companies are needed. ‘When my service to the state is completed, I seriously plan to compete with our dear brother Yevgeny Prigozhin and create a private military company. ‘I think it will all work out.’ Kadyrov appears to have formed a tacit alliance with Prigozhin against the military top brass in Russia, with each amplifying the other’s criticisms and calling for more force in the Ukrainian conflict. Last week, reports suggested Putin was scaling down the Wagner Group’s numbers in Ukraine over concerns they had grown too influential. The Russian president was said to be fearful that he could be vulnerable to a leadership bid by Prigozhin if he grows too powerful in the warzone. Evidence also suggests the Kremlin has ordered the mercenary boss to halt his public criticism of the defence ministry while advising state media to stop mentioning him or Wagner by name. Kadyrov said ‘private military companies’ were ‘both needed and necessary’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
