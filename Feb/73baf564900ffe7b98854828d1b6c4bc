Beauty really is in the AI of the beholder… a super computer has crunched numbers from social media likes to create what it thinks are the most fanciable people in the world. Using best-rated images from sites such as Instagram and Twitter for its algorithms, the data-led dreamer assembled the most desired aesthetic ideals for people from 14 countries including the UK, India and China. Chiselled jaws, moody looks and an absence of shirts feature strongly among the men, while women with long hair and wide-set eyes appear to have set the software’s heart fluttering. San Francisco machine learning firm Midjourney was commissioned by the cosmetics firm NordChem to produce the set of images. ‘As a health and beauty brand, we’re always looking to understand what beautiful looks like to our customers,’ said Samantha Haines, NordChem Health & Beauty’s marketing manager. ‘While to us, beauty means so much more than how someone looks, the style of their hair, or even the size of their muscles, this AI is an incredible tool that gives us an insight into commonly held perceptions of beauty and perfection in a variety of countries around the world.’ It’s not known if the machine has any plans for its gallery of perfect faces… but perhaps it is working on some Chat(up)GPT lines!
