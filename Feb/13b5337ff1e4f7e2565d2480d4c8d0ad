A yellow weather warning for fog is in place for large parts of the UK this morning and could cause huge travel disruptions. According to the Met Office commuters could face slower journey times with potential delays to bus and train services. There is also a chance of further delays or cancellations to flights, the forecaster warned. It said large areas of fog have developed across much of England overnight with visibility of 50-100 metres in many places leading to ‘challenging’ travel conditions. The fog will gradually lift through mid to late morning, according to the Met. Just last week freezing fog blanketed London and people in the capital were told to brace for travel disruption due to reduced visibility. Earlier this year, the first fog of 2023 saw thousands of people facing cancellations at Heathrow, as more than 80 British Airways flights were grounded due to the weather. Freezing fog is typically seen on winter days when there are clear skies, calm winds and when the temperature is below freezing. According to the UK Met Office, it forms in the same way as normal fog – when the land cools overnight under clear skies. As it does so, the heat radiates upwards into space, cooling the earth’s surface. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
