John Fury angrily hit back at a reporter who asked for an update on the ‘all or nothing’ between Jake Paul and Tommy Fury. During the build up to the highlight anticipated fight in Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening, Paul offered Tommy Fury the chance to earn double his prize money. ‘Bring out the contract, lawyers already drafted it up this week,’ Paul said during a head-to-head interview with his opponent. ‘And like I said, if I can reiterate; if I win, I take all the money you’re being paid. If you win, I double it up.’ Tommy Fury immediately said he was willing to sign the deal but was then stopped by his father, John, who asked for the papers to be sent to his legal team for review. However, John Fury was also adamant that the all-or-nothing deal would be signed by his son. ‘You’ve got my word as the head of the Fury clan, he will definitely sign that,’ John Fury said. ‘You’ve got my word on that.’ However, when asked just hours before the fight on Sunday night about what happened with the proposed deal, John Fury replied: ‘Let’s talk about boxing.’ When the reporter replied, ‘it’s certainly is a deal about boxing’, John Fury replied, ‘is it?’ before adding, ‘I’m concentrating’. When asked again before leaving the room, John Fury was visibly annoyed by the question and snapped, ‘why don’t you shut up?’. John Fury then blocked the question once again and fired back: ‘Listen, video boy. Just shut up, video boy. Little nobody.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
