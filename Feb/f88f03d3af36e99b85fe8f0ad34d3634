A 15-year-old boy died after his older brother allegedly shot him in the head. Steven Estevez, succumbed to his injuries on February 17 and police on Tuesday classified his death as a homicide. His brother, David Estevez, 17, was arrested shortly after in connection with the incident, public records show. David told cops that he was in a room with his brother inside a Staten Island apartment and was playing with a silver gun when he accidentally shot him, SILive.com reported. Immediately after the shooting, David allegedly hid the firearm, possibly because he was afraid. Cops later found the weapon. Police responded to a 911 call for a male shot around 11.55pm on February 16 at their apartment on Thomson Street near Wright Street in the Stapleton neighborhood. First responders transported Steven, in critical condition, to Richmond University Medical Center in West Brighton. David was arrested around 9.30pm and charged with assault, criminal possession of a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of a weapon. He was arraigned in a criminal court in St George and pleaded not guilty, public records show. It was not immediately clear if prosecutors will upgrade charges against him. The Legal Aid Society, which was assigned to represent David, called it an ‘incredibly tragic case’. ‘Out of respect for our client, his family and community, we ask the public to refrain from drawing hasty conclusions and to respect the family’s privacy during this extraordinarily difficult time of mourning,’ stated the organization. ‘We will have more to say about this case in the coming days, weeks and months after a thorough review and investigation.’ David’s next court appearance is set for March 6. Steven attended Ralph R McKee High School and played on the McKee-Staten Island Technical High School junior varsity football team.
