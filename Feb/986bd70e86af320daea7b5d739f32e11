The teen, named locally as Harley, was attacked on Kings Mill Lane in Aspley, Huddersfield, early on Monday morning. So far, police have arrested six people in connection with his death. Tributes have been posted across social media in the days following the incident, with Harley described as a much-loved son, cousin and nephew who had a ‘beautiful smile’. Brett Whitehead, Harley’s cousin, told YorkshireLive: ‘He’s a good kid with the most respect anyone could have – if you did good by him he did more than good by you. ‘He had manners, he was just getting himself on the right track and was taken way too early. ‘He will forever be with us in our hearts and minds with his cheeky little smile spreading joy.’ Danny Stephenson, Harley’s uncle, wrote: ‘Rest easy now Harley uncle Dan loves you. No matter what people may say or think of this lad his heart was always pure. ‘Keep being you up there with that beautiful smile.’ West Yorkshire Police detectives are continuing to investigate the attack, which took place just before 4am yesterday. Officers arrested two males aged 15 and 19 this morning on suspicion of murder. A 17-year-old female was also arrested in connection with the investigation. All remain in custody for questioning.
