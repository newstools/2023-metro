Graham Potter has left the Chelsea squad unconvinced that he is the right man for the club after a dismal run of results. The former Brighton boss is under severe pressure at Stamford Bridge following a 1-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday. That was the low point of an increasingly poor season for the Blues, who have won just two of their last 14 matches in all competitions. Having replaced Thomas Tuchel in the early stages of the season, Potter has been given time to settle in west London. There is an acceptance from the board that this is a unique season in Chelsea’s recent history, what with the club’s takeover and £600m spend. Potter is liked by Chelsea’s players and they are sympathetic to his plight, understanding that he’s far from the only issue in west London. But, nevertheless, the Evening Standard says the squad have question marks over his ability to come through such a difficult period and whether he’s the right man for the Blues. After a 1-0 defeat to Dortmund in the first-leg, Chelsea must come from behind to progress to the quarter-finals in the Champions League. But they face a trip to rivals Tottenham on Sunday, where Antonio Conte could pile more misery on his former side. The Blues hope to have Thiago Silva and Reece James available again for selection.
