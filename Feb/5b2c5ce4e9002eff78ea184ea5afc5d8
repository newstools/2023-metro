One very lucky person will get the surprise of their life after winning $754 million (£621 million) in the US Powerball lottery. The winner, who is yet to come forward, is from Washington State and matched the winning numbers of 05, 11, 22, 23, 69 and the Powerball 07. It is the fifth largest win in the game’s history, and the winner has the option to receive the lump sum, or a separated payment plan. There are several other big winners from the draw, including two in Michigan and three in New York – who all won $1 million after matching the first five numbers. The jackpot soared on Monday when nobody matched six numbers in the draw on Saturday night. It’s the first time there has been a Powerball jackpot win since November last year. The single winner in that prize, from Kansas, took home $92.9 million. But it was dwarfed earlier that month by someone from California winning $2.04 billion – the largest Powerball prize ever. The odds of winning at the time were one in 292.2 million, so there’s a lot of luck involved. The next Powerball draw is scheduled for Wednesday night, when the jackpot is about $20 million. Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
