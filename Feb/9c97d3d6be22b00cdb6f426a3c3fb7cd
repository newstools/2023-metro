A 3.7 magnitude earthquake has struck the North Sea, not far from the Norfolk coast. Tremors hit 56 miles off the coast at around 7.14am on Sunday, France’s Military Applications Division said. The British Geological Society (BGS) has confirmed it was recorded at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles). The quake is classed as ‘shallow’ – which means it is more likely to be felt. Those living in Sea Palling, around 38 miles away, may have noted movement. People in Cromer, 42 miles away, and Great Yarmouth, 45 miles distance, also could have experienced the quake. It comes after an earthquake woke up people in Essex on Thursday – with some residents hearing a ‘loud bang’. The 2.6 magnitude quake happened in Bicknacre, Chelmsford, at around 5.05am and at a depth of about 9km (5.5 miles). One local told the BGS it was ‘was like an underground train going under our bungalow’. Meanwhile, South Woodham Ferrers resident Darren Draper said he thought he was getting burgled at first. Darren, who was about four miles south of the epicentre, told BBC Essex: ‘Just after 05:00 there was a very loud bang – but I didn’t really feel any earth shaking or anything. ‘It was very strange. My son shot out of bed as well and we were just looking at one another, going ‘what was that?’ – I thought we were getting broken into. ‘There were a few other neighbours out in the street, so we all heard it.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
