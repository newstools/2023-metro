According to Jennifer Lopez, ‘commitment is sexy’… so much so that she and Ben Affleck have new ink to symbolise their love. On this year’s Valentine’s Day, celebrities from David and Victoria Beckham to Emily Ratajkowski and Eric Andre took to social media to celebrate their relationships, sharing the affection that they feel for each other. Shortly after being seen at the Grammys together – and before earning millions for a joint Dunkin Donuts Super Bowl commercial – Jennifer, 53, and Ben, 50, looked as loved up as ever as they marked their first February 14 as a married couple. In a post shared by the Love Don’t Cost A Thing singer, she showcased a tattoo on her ribcage, which features an infinity symbol with an arrow piercing through it. ‘Commitment ♾️Happy Valentine’s Day my love 🤍,’ she wrote in the caption, alongside the hashtags ‘#CommitmentIsSexy #ThisIsUsThen #ThisIsUsNow #ThisIsMeNow.’ The third picture on the post showed another tattoo, with two arrows crossed into an X shape with the initials J and B, with it believed that this design belonged to the Gone Girl actor. While the tattoos aren’t identical, they were matching in the sense that they were related to the same theme, as well as both featuring arrows in their designs. In more pictures from the same post, Jennifer and Ben were seen canoodling with one another, with a couple of the photos taken during a boat excursion, and another when the pair were embracing at the table. Several fellow famous faces commented on the post, including Nope star Keke Palmer, who wrote: ‘Gon’ head girl!’ One fan wrote: ‘There’s something about you both being drawn back together again that makes me feel love,’ after Jennifer and Ben reunited 17 years after their previous break-up. Years ago, the couple were engaged, but called it quits in 2004, before both going on to marry other people. In 2021, they reconciled before embarking on a whirlwind romance that led to their second engagement in April 2022 and their nuptials three months later. Earlier this year, Jennifer opened up about Ben’s idea for them to elope to Las Vegas, telling Jimmy Kimmel on his US talkshow: ‘We were so happy, and of course it was happening, but I just felt the wedding was so stressful,’ she recalled, before her beau put forward his idea.
