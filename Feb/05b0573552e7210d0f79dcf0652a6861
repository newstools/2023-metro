A woman was left wondering ‘2V or not 2V?’ after discovering the face of William Shakespeare in her ceiling light. Rebecca Manville, 41, had been rearranging furniture in her lounge when she spotted a familiar shape in the bulb above her. But she couldn’t quite place what it was – was it a dagger which she saw before her? No, it was clearly a person. Ben Jonson or Christopher Marlowe? Close, but not quite. Rebecca, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: ‘It was on the tip of my tongue. I could see the picture but couldn’t think of the name. ‘Then I put it on Facebook and people said it was Shakespeare.’ The image in the LED bulb is unmistakably the Bard, specifically the famous portrait featured in the First Folio. His distinctive bald-bob hairdo, tiny moustache and even his ruff can all be made out. Rebecca, who works as a consultant, said the oldest parts of her farmhouse date back to 1560 – four years before the playwright was born. The ceiling light, as you might expect, is in the newer part of the home, so it’s unlikely Shakespeare has returned Banquo-like to light up an old haunt. Rebecca said: ‘I am a Shakespeare fan and a theatre grad so for me it was quite interesting. ‘It’s probably him getting revenge after all these years of us doing his plays. A Midsummer Night’s Dream is my favourite.’ The strange sighting is the latest in a string of famous faces cropping up in unusual places. Last month, Metro.co.uk reported on a woman who believed she saw the face of Jesus in her greasy pizza box – though it may have been Hagrid from Harry Potter. Then there was the Beatles fan who found John Lennon in his pint glass while out for a drink in Liverpool – though some said it looked more like Robert Smith from The Cure. And who could forget the Boris biryani from October last year, when the ex-prime minister turned up in someone’s plate of curry? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
