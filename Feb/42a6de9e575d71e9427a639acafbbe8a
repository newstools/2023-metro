A soldier who took her own life in her barracks had no known history of mental health issues, an inquest has heard. Lance Corporal Aneika Browne, 28, showed no signs of internal struggle besides admitting during a consultation five months before her death that she was ‘feeling down’ after a break-up. Her brother Vaughan told the coroner Aneika had a ‘great time’ with him only the weekend before her death and refused to believe she could have died by suicide. The inquest was launched after her body was found in her room at Pirbright Army Training Centre, Surrey, when she failed to turn up for duty on the morning of August 4, 2021. A post-mortem found no alcohol or drugs in her system at the time of her death. Police found no signs of forced entry or any evidence of third-party involvement. Aneika was born on the Caribbean island of St Vincent, and moved to the UK in 2016, joining the army a year later. She had been following in the footsteps of her brother, who had done the same in 2008. The 28-year-old was described as being ‘very sociable’ with a ‘good group of friends’ and enjoyed partying on the weekends. Giving a verdict of suicide, the coroner said she should have been flagged as vulnerable after admitting to ‘feeling down’ but accepted this was not a serious missed opportunity as she never disclosed the ‘extent of her mental turmoil’. Vaughan said in his statement: ‘All my family are in complete shock.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
