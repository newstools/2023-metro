Nearly 100 well-wishers turned up to the funeral of an RAF veteran after learning he was due to have just one mourner. Ronald Gale, a 97-year-old from Ipswich, Suffolk, who served in World War Two, died in December but never married and had no children or close family. Just one neighbour and two lawyers were initially registered to attend the service, but the Royal British Legion made a public appeal after learning of the situation. It turned out Mr Gale was also close with two other neighbours, who eagerly took up the opportunity to pay their respects. The appeal then spread like wildfire locally, and the service ended up so busy that the doors of the chapel at Ipswich Crematorium were kept open to allow people to hear from outside. They were joined by uniformed representatives of the Army, RAF and cadets, as well as bagpiper who played as Mr Gale’s hearse arrived and a bugler who played at the service. Neighbour Des Welham said: ‘I think he’d be shocked to see how many people have turned out for him today. ‘It was a beautiful service and so moving to see so many come to pay their respects.’ ‘He’d be so taken aback’, added Maisie Perry, a close friend and neighbour of the veteran. Arun Achary said: ‘Myself, Maisie and Des would often take him out for meals. ‘He was a wonderful man. He was caring and so polite. Every day he would be sharply dressed in a suit.’ Little is known of Mr Gale’s military service besides a picture taken in July 1944 revealing he was part of the No. 47 Flight Squadron and No. 36 R&C Wing squad at the time.
