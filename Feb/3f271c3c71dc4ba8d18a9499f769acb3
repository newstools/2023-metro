Jose Mourinho was shown a red card for the third time this season after his Roma team were stunned 2-1 at Italian minnows Cremonese on Tuesday. The result was a massive upset and marked Cremonese’s first Serie A win of the season – in their 24th top-flight match – to take them off the bottom of the table. Cremonese, promoted last term, had already eliminated Roma from the Coppa Italia to reach their first semi-final since 1986-87 but Tuesday’s win saw them pick up their first Serie A victory in 26 years against one of the biggest clubs in Italy. Former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham boss Mourinho lost his cool during the match and was sent off early into the second half for dissent against the fourth official when his side were 1-0 down. Speaking after the match, Mourinho said: ‘There are people who have known me for many years. I’m emotional, but I’m not crazy. ‘To have a reaction like the one I had is because something happened. ‘We need to understand if I can do something from a legal point of view, because (referee) Piccinini gave me the red because the fourth official told him to do it. ‘Unfortunately the fourth man didn’t have the honesty to tell him what he told me, how he said it and how he treated me. ‘That’s obviously what gave rise to my reaction.’ Mourinho, who has also managed Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Porto, arrived as Roma boss in 2021 and led them to Europa Conference League glory last season. The Portuguese boss has been linked with a third spell at Chelsea with current Blues head coach Graham Potter under huge pressure at Stamford Bridge. Richard Keys has urged Todd Boehly to sack Potter and hire Mourinho as his replacement, although it is believed that the Englishman’s job is safe for now.
