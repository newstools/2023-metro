Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is on the verge of leaving Chelsea for Los Angeles FC, according to reports in France. The 33-year-old has struggled to make an impact since his move from Barcelona last summer and was dropped from Chelsea’s Champions League squad last week in order to make way for Joao Felix, Mykhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez to be added to the 25-man list. Following Chelsea’s decision to sign five new attacking players in the January transfer window, Aubameyang’s chances of playing time appear to be heavily reduced for the remainder of the season. According to Le10 Sport, Chelsea have now reached an agreement to loan Aubameyang to Los Angeles FC for the remainder of the campaign. The report claims that only the final details remain before the deal is completed, while Aubameyang still needs to agree to join the Major League Soccer side. Aubameyang has scored just three goals in 17 appearances since joining Chelsea in a £10.3 million deal last September. The 33-year-old was signed at the request of Thomas Tuchel, who was then sacked by Chelsea just days after the striker made the move to Stamford Bridge. Following the decision to omit Aubameyang from the Champions League squad, the striker was not in the squad for the goalless draw with Fulham last Friday and was pictured with his brother in Milan. Meanwhile, Los Angeles FC’s new MLS season is due to begin later this month as their first league game is against rivals LA Galaxy on February 26. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
