One bride’s wedding day was made even more special by the fact that she could see certain colours for the first time – including her husband’s eyes. Kristin Robinson, of Harleysville, Pennsylvania, lives with red-green color blindness – which means she is unable to see pinks and purples. But, thanks to a pair of special glasses, her special day was a lot more vibrant. When Kristin popped on the glasses for the first time at the altar, she was able to finally agree with her fiancé, Nick, that his eyes were green – having previously seen them as blue. She was also amazed by her bouquet of flowers, which she saw as pink and white for the first time – having previously viewed them as all-white. In a clip of the wedding, Kristin can be seen in shock. ‘That’s so cool,’ she said. ‘Are those pink flowers? I’ve never seen anything like that. ‘I’ve always dreamed of this; I finally get to see the colors.’ The couple, who got married at Walt Disney World, spent the evening of their wedding watching fireworks at the resort. Groom Nick said he was thrilled to ‘amplify’ the special day for his new wife. He said: ‘I’m just so happy – I get chills thinking about it.’ Do you have a story to share?
