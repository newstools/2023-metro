Stacey Solomon has shown off some gorgeous pictures of her baby bump, thanking her body for past pregnancies as she prepares for the end of her current one. The TV star, who us expecting a little girl ‘any day now’ with husband Joe Swash, 41, is already a mum of four. She has three older boys, 14-year-old Zachary who she shares with ex Dean Cox, her and Aaron Barham’s 10-year-old Leighton, and three-year-old Rex, who was her and Joe’s first child. Stacey, 33, and Joe also welcomed their one-year-old daughter Rose together in October 2021, on the Loose Women presenter’s birthday. Joe also has a 15-year-old son called Harry, who he shares with former partner Emma Sophocleous. Taking to social media on Tuesday, Stacey posted two selfies of herself beaming in grey pyjama shorts and a strappy top, which was pulled up to reveal her belly. She captioned it: ‘🤍 Thank you for everything bump 🤍 Woken up with that feeling and so just in case I don’t get the chance to say it tomorrow… I’m so grateful for them all.’ ‘For every single time you’ve done this,’ she added, referring to her past successful pregnancies as she shared a hint she reckoned her labour would start soon. The former X Factor singer’s meaningful post touched her friends and followers, who shared their reactions in the comments section. ‘So emotional!!! This set me off 😭😭😭 all the best Stacey, you got this mama,’ posted one supportive pal. ‘You deserve so much happiness ❤️,’ added another, while Samantha Faiers wrote: ‘❤️ glowing mumma x Eagle-eyed fans are convinced they have worked out the name of Stacey and Joe’s baby following a recent Instagram post, but she has so fat remained schtum on the matter. When Stacey announced she was expecting her fifth child, the star said: ‘So grateful & cannot believe I’m saying this… Another little pickle is on the way… A HUGE surprise, but one that we are so thankful for to the moon & back bub.’ She wrote of her surprise alongside a very cute video of her surprising Joe with a pregnancy test, to which he responded: ‘You’re joking!
