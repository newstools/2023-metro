The Manchester United first team fear the return of Mason Greenwood could disrupt their season and are against the forward being reintroduced to the squad. The 21-year-old had charges of attempted rape, ABH and controlling and coercive behaviour dropped earlier this week. However, he remains suspended by the Red Devils, who are going to conduct their own internal investigation before deciding what to do with Greenwood. Though Greenwood has not been found guilty of any crime, the club are investigating images and audio that were posted online by his alleged victim. The club will take into account the view of their sponsors before making a decision on Greenwood’s future. But they must also consider the views of the United squad. Following the turmoil under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, the dressing room has healed under Erik ten Hag. There is a harmony and togetherness in the squad that has been missing for years and United are still battling on all four fronts this season. And the Sun reports that the first team squad feel Greenwood’s return would bring a level of scrutiny that could disrupt the remainder of the season. While the players are open to reintegrating Greenwood next season, they want to remain focused on the remainder of the current campaign.
