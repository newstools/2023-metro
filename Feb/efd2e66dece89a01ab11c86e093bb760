Neymar has confirmed he was involved in a heated discussion with PSG’s sporting director Luis Campos following last weekend’s defeat against Monaco. The Ligue 1 champions lead at the top of the table was whittled down to five points hot on the heels of a damaging cup defeat against Marseille. The comprehensive 3-1 defeat against Monaco represented a fourth loss in 10 games and it would have been far heavier if not for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Campos was reportedly so angered by the abject performance that he argued with Neymar and captain Marquinhos later. ‘Yes there was a discussion, we didn’t agree with what we heard,’ Neymar said, speaking ahead of tomorrow Champions League clash against Bayern Munich. ‘But these things happen. Football isn’t just about love and friendship.’ Comparing it to an argument with his girlfriend, Neymar said straight talking is necessary. ‘The respect is there but there are times when you don’t agree and discussions happen to make things better,’ Neymar said. ‘It’s true that our recent performances haven’t been very good. Of course it’s unsettling when there are defeats.’ Neymar, however, was also upset that the dispute was leaked. ‘It’s not normal that everything that happens comes out of the dressing room, it should stay between us,’ he said. ‘We know that we have some weaknesses, but I’m sure we’ll see the best of PSG tomorrow.’ MORE : Inquiry blames UEFA for Champions League final fiasco and credits Liverpool fans with saving lives MORE : ‘Congratulations brother!’ – Neymar sends message to Lionel Messi after World Cup triumph
