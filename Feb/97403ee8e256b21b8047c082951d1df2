Not all relationships last – but it seems we’re pretty good at looking back and learning from them, according to a new study. In fact, on the whole, we’re a pretty reflective bunch. New research suggests 75% view their past relationships as a learning experience. Digging into the specifics, it seems we’re pretty good at holding ourselves accountable – with 70% of younger singles saying they were the reason past relationships fizzled out. In the poll of 2,000 Gen-Z and millennial singles, many said they felt like the ‘anti-hero’ of their current dating life – with 61% of men and 50% of women assuming they caused their most recent dates to go poorly. What’s more, 75% of men revealed they ‘know exactly’ what they did to ruin their past dates – including looking at their phone too much (46%), arriving late (39%) and not offering to pick up the bill (39%). The study, carried out by Plenty of Fish in partnership with A Call to Men, also found that more than half (60%) are actively working on themselves for future relationships – and 93% believe these efforts will pay off and will help them find ‘the one’. Shannon Smith, public relations director at Plenty of Fish, said: ‘The data shows that the vast majority of singles are actually quite cognizant of the habits or behaviors that are potentially sabotaging their dates or relationships. ‘As a result, they are putting in the effort to build on their experiences to become more compassionate communicators, better listeners, and generally more self-aware – thereby creating a more welcoming environment to date better.’ Do you have a story to share?
