A small dog decided to challenge a shark to a fight – and won. Astonishing footage shows British and American tourists screaming as a dog leaped at a 12-foot hammerhead during a Bahamas boat trip. However, in defiance of the food chain, the dog managed to scare the shark away from the boat, sending it swimming back out into the ocean. People pleaded with the dog to ‘get out’ and to ‘stop doing that’ as the pup gave the sea beast a pummeling. The pair thrashed at each other in the water – and to everyone’s surprise the dog walked away victorious. One man is heard saying: ‘I don’t think the shark is going to mess with him!’ The dog proudly sauntered off to the applause of tourists and shouts of ‘good boy!’ Someone asked: ‘How’d he get away with that?’ The shark had emerged from under the boat during a tour on Wednesday in the southern Bahamas organized by Exuma Water Sports. Company reservations manager Rebecca Lightbourn said the black-and-tan dog always runs along the shore to greet the boat when it passes that island. However it’s the first time it was seen diving in. ‘I guess this time the dog decided he wanted to protect his house or play with a really big fish in the water, so he went after it,’ Lightbourn said. Speaking to Today, she said the dog – nicknamed ‘Rufus’ – was a Bahamian Potcake, and belongs to a caretaker on the private island. She confirmed Rufus is ‘100% A-ok’.
