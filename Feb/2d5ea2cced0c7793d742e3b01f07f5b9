The Masked Singer tonight unveiled Knitting as Claire Richards, as the Steps singer became the sixth celebrity to be unveiled. The popularÂ ITVÂ competition series sees a host of stars sport extravagant costumes while belting out tunes, while judgesÂ Rita Ora,Â Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall and Mo Gilligan guess their identity. In the latest instalment of the juggernaut series, presented by Joel Dommett, Knitting was finally revealed to be Claire! Viewers had been pretty convinced it would be Claire, after cryptic clues included â€˜all the worldâ€™s a stageâ€™ and that they â€˜used to be in the backgroundâ€™ led many to believe that Knitting used to be in a band. Other clues included that they learned skills by â€˜watching and copyingâ€™, perhaps referring to when Steps supported Britney Spears. Meanwhile, early on in the competition, Davina noted Â a clue in the knitting needles of â€˜4Mâ€™ which could be the amount of singles the band had sold, and seemed to remember Claire being on a show where she learned to breathe fire, which could explain the â€˜dragon breathâ€™ clue. However, Claire actually explained that the four knitting needles referred to Big Brother, in which she finished fourth. â€˜I thought you were just going to get me from day one, so when you didnâ€™t I was so chuffed,â€™ she told the judges after being announced. â€˜I feel like a fan who has won a competition,â€™ she added, joking that her son might be â€˜mortifiedâ€™ at the surprise. Claire had hilariously joined in on the guessing fun on Twitter, trolling fans with her commentary. Ahead of being unveiled, during Knittingâ€™s first performance, Claire penned: â€˜Still so confused! #knitting. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s Jane Macdonald anymore ðŸ¤” but who??? @MaskedSingerUKâ€™. After the unveiling, Davina praised Claireâ€™s â€˜stunningâ€™ voice while Rita commented: â€˜Your voice is fantastic. And the tragedy thing was such a huge clue.â€™ The Masked Singer continues next Saturday on ITV1. Got a story?
