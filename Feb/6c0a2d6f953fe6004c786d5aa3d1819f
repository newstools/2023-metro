Will the real Jamie Oliver please stand up? As, it appears the famous TV chef has gone AWOL and, in his place, a very unrecognisable man kissing his wife Jools on Valentine’s Day. Jamie’s followers have been left both baffled and in hysterics after Jools, 48, shared a sweet Instagram photo to mark the most romantic day of the year. It seemed like a fairly normal post at first, with Jamie, 47, sharing a passionate smooch with his wife of 22 years. However, on closer look, the man puckering up to Jools actually looks nothing like Jamie and fans are convinced he’s been replaced making for a very hilarious comment section. In the picture, Jamie seems to have permed his hair – or at least not styled his typically short straight barnet for a change – as the chef is sporting a thick set of curls in the photo, which appears to be a throwback taken on a much warmer, sunnier day with him wearing a tropical shirt. ‘Happy ❤️ day to my everything and my favourite over 30 Valentines later 🤍🏹💥 xxx,’ Jools captioned the photo. However, all her followers were concerned about was who exactly was that man in the photo – because it certainly didn’t look like her husband Jamie. One commented: ‘Is that Jamie???? Looks so different.’ Totally convinced Jools was kissing another man, another stated: ‘That’s not Jamie.’ ‘Ooooh I’m telling Jamie!!’ one joked, while another follower wanted to know: ‘Who are you kissing!?’ Remarking on Jamie’s curls, one said: ‘Is that a perm?’ Setting the record straight – or, at least, attempting to – one other follower weighed in: ‘Everyone needs to settle down – that’s Jamie, it’s called aging and they both look fantastic!’ Of course, it is Jamie (we think) as he and Jools have been loved-up for over two decades, marrying in July 2000 and going on to have five children; Poppy, 20, Daisy, 19, Petal, 13, Buddy (or Buds), 12, and River, six. In 2021, Jamie revealed Jools wasn’t quite done having kids and joked that he ‘didn’t have a choice in the matter’ seeing as his partner is ‘just so maternal and she’s got so much love to give’.
