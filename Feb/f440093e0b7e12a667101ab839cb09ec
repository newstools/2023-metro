One of the UK’s most beloved train station cats has died, leaving ‘thousands’ of his fans heartbroken. Hector became famous after he began wandering the platforms in Redruth, Cornwall, in 2013. He became so comfortable roaming around the station, he would often welcome passengers before they boarded, and take naps in the ticket office. A post on Hector’s Facebook page wrote: ‘We’re so sorry to say that Hector has sadly passed away, one of his slaves made it to the vets in time to say goodbye. ‘We knew he had a heart murmur and the vets believe it was his poorly heart that unfortunately gave up. ‘We will be having him cremated and he will sit under his picture forever. Thank you so much for all the well wishes it’s really appreciated.’ It is believed Hector reached the age of 14 before his passing was announced yesterday. Hector was so loved commuters even started his own piggy bank to pay towards food, vet bills and his ongoing care. Tributes have poured in, with passengers utterly devastated they will no longer be seeing him everyday. Paul Woolga wrote: ‘Such sad news. I looked out for him every day I used the train and never failed to be amused by the sight of him sprawled out on the waiting room sofa.’ British Transport Police added their own tribute, tweeting: ‘Our thoughts are with everyone at #Redruth Station today, after our friend #Hector the Station Cat sadly passed away.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
