The problem is, it takes time and effort to find someone you want to sleep with – and that’s not always an option. Masturbation is a good way to bridge the gap until your next hot date, but there are a few ways to simulate the partnered experience and level up your orgasms. Sexual tech has come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, with today’s toys offering the sensation of tongues, fingers, and realistic genitals. Not only do these futuristic toys look discreet (no full-scale sex dolls here), they also have features like warming to give you the partnered sex experience. Whatever your preferences in the bedroom, there’s a toy to suit you. Best of all, you don’t have to deal with any awkward morning after smalltalk. Do you have a story to share?
