A woman wearing a hijab was attacked on a London bus in what police are treating as a religiously-aggravated assault. The victim, aged in her 40s, was on the Route 207 bus to Ealing from Westfield Shopping Centre in White City when the incident happened on November 27, 2022. She was approached by a man, who started speaking to her. The woman explained she did not want to engage with him, but he ignored her request. He went on to make unwanted comments before assaulting her. The man then got off the bus on Uxbridge Road, close to the town hall. Detectives carried out a number of inquiries, including a review of CCTV from the bus. Police have now launched an appeal to the public asking for help with the investigation. The woman did not require hospital treatment. To remain anonymous contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
