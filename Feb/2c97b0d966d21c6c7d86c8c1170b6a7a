A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been charged with rape by Essex Police. Pc Jordan Pascal, of the Met’s Taskforce, is alleged to have sexually assaulted a woman back in 2009. He joined the Met in June 2012 and has now been suspended from duty, Scotland Yard said today. Pascal was charged on February 2. He is due to appear at Southend Magistrates’ Court on Monday March 13. Chief Superintendent Claire Smart, who leads the Met’s Taskforce Command, said: ‘PC Pascal has been suspended and criminal proceedings will now follow. ‘While I recognise the inevitable strength of public feeling, is important that nothing is said that will put those proceedings at risk.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
