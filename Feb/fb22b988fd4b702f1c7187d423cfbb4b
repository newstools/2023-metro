It’s fair to say that countries are protective of their national dishes. You only have to look at the uproar that putting tomatoes into carbonara caused to know this to be true. So in a move that is set to raise eyebrows both in Italy, and on home soil, cult fave pizza restaurant Homeslice has collabed with The Mayfair Chippy to launch a fish and chip pizza. Yep, fish and chips, but on a pizza. The team have gifted the nation with this, erm, unusual combination, in honour of National Pizza Day which is celebrated tomorrow, 9 February. But before you go turning your nose up, this pairing actually sounds pretty delicious. Firstly, Homeslice’s huge pizza bases have long been a favourite amongst Londoners, and The MayFair Chippy isn’t the kind of place that serves soggy fish cakes – their posh fish and chips are literally award winning. Not too shabby. Homeslice’s signature 24-hour proven dough is topped with salt and vinegar cured cod, pea puree, crispy chips, and capers. And for the Northerners wanting a touch of home, the pizza also features a sprinkling of batter scraps. If you really needed any more reason to try this Anglo-Italian feast, to wash your slice down, Homeslice will give you a free mojito from canned cocktails brand, MOTH. You’ll also be doing some good while you feast, as £3 from each pizza sold will go to the Felix Project. If you fancy trying this new delicacy head down to Homeslice Marylebone, where the pizza will be available for the next fortnight. Do you have a story to share?
