Gabriel Martinelli is ‘phyiscally and mentally tired’ and should be dropped for Arsenal’s top of the table clash against Manchester City. That’s according to former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit, who believes Martinelli is having a ‘difficult’ time at the moment. The Brazilian has been one of Arsenal’s outstanding players this term and has netted seven times in 29 matches. However, he’s failed to score in his last seven appearances and has just two goals in his last 12 matches. Leandro Trossard’s arrival has eased the burden on Martinelli and the Belgian scored his first goal for the club in a draw against Brentford on Saturday. And Petit believes it’s time for Martinelli to take a spell out of the side for Trossard, starting with Wednesday’s crunch clash against City. ‘I’m not surprised that he’s having a difficult time at the moment. He looks tired – mentally and physically,’ Petit told Compare Bet.‘I would also say he has a tough time due to the tactical setup. With Zinchenko tucking inside to the midfield, he doesn’t get the same support as Saka does on the right side with Ben White. ‘Maybe he [Trossard] should start, but I’m pretty sure Arteta will start Martinelli. I think Trossard is a good option and he’s shown Arteta that he can trust him as a starter in the first eleven.’ Erling Haaland is set to be fit, despite coming off against Aston Villa on Sunday with a thigh injury.
