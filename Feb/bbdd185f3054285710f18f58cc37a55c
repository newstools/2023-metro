A mother was arrested after her child wrote a story in her kindergarten class about her firing a gun while her parents were fighting. Kaydra Johnson, 28, was walking around her home when sheriff’s deputies arrived on Monday. They responded to the home on Longleaf Oak Cove in Arlington, after a Donelson Elementary School counselor contacted the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services. The teacher reported possible child abuse after Johnson’s daughter wrote about an argument between her parents that involved gunfire, WREG reported. ‘Mother and father got into a fight. Mom told him to get out because he was smoking too much. Father hit mother in the eye. Mother said look what you’ve done,’ wrote the kindergartner wrote. ‘Mother got the gun from under the bed. I was in the living room, and my sisters and brother were in the room. Mother pulled the gun on father and shot three times. ‘The bullets hit the wall. Mother told him to sleep in his car in the driveway and not to come back or she will shoot him again.’ Johnson told responding deputies that she was locked out for an hour and that her children aged one and four were inside the house. Deputies entered through the garage door and firefighters found four children, who did not look harmed. Deputies recovered two guns from the home. Johnson has been charged with four counts of reckless endangerment. She was freed from jail on her own recognizance. Her court date has been set for February 23. Custody of two of the kids was given to their grandmother, and the other two to an aunt. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
