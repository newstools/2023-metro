The border region of Turkey and Syria has been hit by another strong earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.3. The Turkish interior minister said three people had been killed and 213 injured, while search and rescue efforts were underway in three collapsed buildings. According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), the latest quake struck at a depth of 1.2 miles. It centred on the Turkish city of Antakya, where further damage was caused to buildings that had already been impacted by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck two weeks ago. Reuters reported tremors from the earthquake this evening could be felt in Egypt and Lebanon. Antakya resident Muna Al Omar said: ‘I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet.’ She asked: ‘Is there going to be another aftershock?’ Turkey’s disaster agency AFAD urged residents to stay away from the Mediterranean coast over a possible 50-centimetre rise in waters due to the quake. Burhan Abdelrahman, who was living in a tent when the ground started shaking, said: ‘It was very strong. It jolted us out of our places. He added: ‘I called relatives in Syria, Adana, Mersin, Izmir, everywhere, to check on them.’ More than 46,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the aftermath of the two quakes that struck in the same region on February 6. The disaster also left more than a million people in the region homeless. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
