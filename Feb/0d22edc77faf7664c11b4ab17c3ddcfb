Volodymyr Zelensky plans to meet with his counterpart in China to negotiate proposals on ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, the Ukrainian president said  he was open to considering parts of a Beijing’s 12-point ‘peace plan’. ‘It’s an important signal that they are preparing to take part in this theme,’ he said during a news conference in Kyiv, referring to China’s bid to broker peace. ‘So far, I see this as a signal – I don’t know what will happen later.’ Zelensky, who stressed Russia-allied China did not offer a concrete plan but some ‘thoughts’, also warned Beijing against providing Moscow with arms. ‘I very much want to believe that China will not deliver weapons to Russia, and for me this is very important. This is point number one,’ he added, striking a receptive tone. But any plan that did not include a full withdrawal of Russian troop would  not be acceptable to the Ukrainian government. Zelensky said he planned to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping but did confirm if and when such a meeting has been scheduled for. ‘I plan to meet Xi Jinping and believe this will be beneficial for our countries and for security in the world,’ the leader said. Meanwhile, he rejected ever holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. China has refrained from condemning its ally Russia or referring to its intervention in Ukraine as an ‘invasion’. Chinese officials have also criticised looming Western sanctions on Russia. ‘All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiralling out of control,’ the ministry said in its paper. But NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Tallinn that China does not have ‘much credibility’ as it has failed to condemn the war.
