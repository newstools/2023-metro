Murderer Russell Causley – who has never revealed where he hid his wife’s body – has been released from prison. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed the news this afternoon. Causley was handed a life sentence for killing wife Carole Packman – who disappeared in 1985 – a year after he moved his lover into their home in Bournemouth, Dorset. Her daughter Sam had been led to believe she’d simply walked out on the family, after finding a note which said that she’d decided to leave. But an insurance scam triggered the police to re-investigate Packman’s disappearance, and in 1996, Causley was convicted of murder. He was initially freed from prison in 2020 after serving more than 23 years for Carole’s murder. But Causley was sent back to jail in November 2021 after breaching his licence conditions. An MoJ spokeswoman said: ‘We know this will be an incredibly difficult time for Carole Packman’s family, but Russell Causley will be under close supervision for the rest of his life and can be recalled to prison if he breaches the strict conditions of his release. ‘Our parole reforms will stand up for the rights of victims in cases like this, making public safety the overriding factor in parole decisions and adding a ministerial veto on release of the most serious offenders.’ The Parole Board ruled last month that Causley was suitable to be released from prison again.
