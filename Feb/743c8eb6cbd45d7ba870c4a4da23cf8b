Four people in the UK have become millionaires, but they still haven’t figured it out yet. Last Friday’s EuroMillions event saw 100 guaranteed millionaires made across Europe, with 31 of them coming from the UK. But four of these British ticket-holders have not yet come forward to claim their life-changing prize. Not many details are known about them, except that three of them bought their tickets in retail and one purchased theirs online. Senior winners’ advisor at The National Lottery, Andy Carter, said: ‘Imagine being a millionaire and not even knowing it. ‘It’s only just under a week since the special draw, but we’re urging all EuroMillions players to check their tickets or log into their National Lottery Account to see if they are one of our missing four £1,000,000 winners. ‘We’ve already started to support the 27 ticket-holders who have claimed their prizes, and we’re hoping that these handful of lucky winners who have yet to check their tickets will now come forward so that they can start to enjoy their amazing win.’ With all National Lottery draws, players have 180 days from the day of the draw to claim their prize if they have the winning ticket. Andy’s job is to help winners through the ‘enormous’ change that comes with winning such a large sum of money. He previously told Metro.co.uk how his team sets up meetings with legal and financial advisers to help with the practical elements. But winners are also given plenty of emotional support, including a life coach, which they can share with their whole families if they choose. ‘Winning the lottery gives you lots and lots of opportunity to do lots of fantastic stuff but it takes a bit of getting used to,’ Andy added.
