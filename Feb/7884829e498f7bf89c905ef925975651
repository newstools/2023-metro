A solar flare erupting from the Sun is set to provide a nice opportunity to see the Northern Lights, late Friday and early Saturday. A geomagnetic storm caused due to a coronal mass ejection (CME) was unleashed from the Sun on 15 February and is expected to hit the Earth tonight. Experts have alerted of possible Aurora sightings in the north of the UK tonight, given skies are clear. The US Space Weather Prediction Center is expecting a minor geomagnetic storm on Friday night that will intensify to a moderate storm early Saturday. The aurora does not need to be directly overhead to spot but can be observed from as much as 1000 km away if the aurora is bright enough and the conditions are right. The storms are classified as G1 and G2-level storms that can potentially impact high-latitude power systems and spacecraft operations. Scientists have their eye on the storms and subsequent warnings and alerts may be issued as conditions progress. These storms pose no danger unless they last a particularly long time, in which case they could damage some large electrical equipment at high latitudes. Massive solar flares also pose risk to certain electronic equipment resulting in large-scale blackouts and damage to satellites. In the past, SpaceX has lost 40 Starlink satellites to geomagnetic space storms.
