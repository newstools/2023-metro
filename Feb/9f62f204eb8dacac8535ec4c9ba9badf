NFL legend Tom Brady has announced his retirement from American football ‘for good’. The 45-year-old announced his was walking away from the sport last year but returned six weeks later to address ‘unfinished business’. But after 23 seasons, the seven-time Super Bowl winner says this is his final decision. In a short video shared on social media, Brady said: ‘Good morning, guys, I’ll get to the point right away: I’m retiring for good. ‘I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first. ‘So I won’t be long-winded. I think you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year. ‘So, really, thank you guys, so much, to every single one of you, for supporting me. ‘My family, my friends, teammates, my competitors, I could go on forever, there’s too many. ‘Thank you, guys, for letting me live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing. Love you all.’ Brady spent 19 years with the New England Patriots where he won six of his Super Bowl titles, adding another with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021. Brady also retires a five-time Super Bowl MVP, a three-time league MVP and the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, quarterback wins and pass completions. His final season with the Buccaneers ended in a 31-14 defeat to the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.
