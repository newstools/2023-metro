Two siblings who went missing last year have been found with their mother dressed in disguise at a supermarket. Brooke and Adrian Gilley, aged 11 and 12, respectively, disappeared in March and were thought to have been kidnapped by their biological mother who did not have custody of them. The young children and their mom, Kristi Gilley, 36, were found at a Winn-Dixie market in High Springs, Florida, last week. They were discovered during a routine traffic check on Kristi’s vehicle that revealed that she was a fugitive fleeing from police in Missouri, stated the High Springs Police Department. Kristi was arrested on an active warrant out of Clay County, which is a suburb of Kansas City. Adrian and Brooke were taken into the care of the Florida Department of Children and Family Services and will be reunited with their birth family, cops said. It was not immediately known how Kristi kidnapped her children and why she had lost custody of them. The mother abducted the children from Clay County. The Liberty Police Department put out a missing juveniles alert for the siblings and issued a felony kidnapping warrant for Kristi on July 13, 2022. Kristi was still in police custody as of Monday morning. She ‘has retained private counsel’, her former attorney William Miller told People. Liberty police in Missouri stated: ‘Both Gilley kids have been safely located out of state. Their non-custodial mother is in custody on parental kidnapping charges… Thank you to everyone who shared this post as it helped bring these children home.’ High Springs is located about 20 miles northwest of Gainesville.
