During various lockdowns, homemade recipes for fast food soared in popularity. From Wagamama’s katsu curry to McDonald’s milkshake, we all got a taste for making our fast food favourites in the comfort of our own homes. Now a chef on Instagram has shared how to make another cult classic – but with a ‘healthier’ twist. US chef Calvin Kang has revealed how to make your own version of the McDonald’s Chicken Sandwich at home. Calvin’s technique involves using spices and seasoning to cover the chicken in a cornflake coating – to get that delicious crunch. His recipe also uses an air fryer – to make the burger healthier than the fast food chain’s offering. The chef also has a spicy version of the burger on his Instagram page and one follower even suggests adding cheese as a final flourish, too. If you’re interested in giving it a go yourself at home, you can find Calvin’s full recipe below. Ingredients: Method: 1. Start by mincing 600g chicken breast and putting it into a bowl, before adding all the seasoning. 2. In a separate bowl, crush the cornflakes. 3. After mixing the chicken and seasoning, shape 105g of the mixture and coat it in cornflakes to make the patties. 4. Put these in an air fryer for 10 minutes around 200°C. 5. While these are cooking, chop up romaine lettuce and assemble the bun with lighter mayonnaise. 6. Then pop your crispy patty in the middle and enjoy. Do you have a story to share?
