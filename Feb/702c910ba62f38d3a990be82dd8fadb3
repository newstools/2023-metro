With hours to go until Mo Gilligan hits the stage to host the Brit Awards 2023, the comedian isn’t letting any trolls dampen his day. Over the past few years, the comic’s star has been continuing to rise in the world of entertainment, going from hosting his late night talk show to being on the judging panel for The Masked Singer UK. Last year, the 34-year-old hosted the Brit Awards at London’s O2 Arena, one of if not the biggest night for music in the UK, and he’s back again to front the ceremony tonight. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a person on Twitter felt the need to express their dislike for Mo on the social media platform, tagging him directly in a post as they wrote: ‘I like @MoTheComedian but lost a lot of respect for him just now.’ While it’s not clear why the individual suddenly ‘lost respect’ for the Celebrity Gogglebox star, nor why they felt the need to tag him, Mo proved the remark was water off a duck’s back with his response. Feigning upset, he quote-tweeted the remark by writing: ‘Let me add it to the second L that I’ve taken today 😞 Or lost 🥴,’ teasing that it’s the ‘second loss’ of the day for him. He also shared a video of himself stating: ‘So, safe to say I took a major L today,’ before showing a close-up of a swish Bentley with the ‘L’ missing from its name. ‘Literally, like the L came off the Bentley,’ he added dryly. One person replied to Mo’s witty comeback by tweeting: ‘This is a different kind of flex.’ ‘#HumbleBrag,’ someone else wrote, while another commented: ‘This guy 😂😂.’ Ahead of his second year in a row of hosting the Brits, Mo also brought back an old tweet that a troll posted last year during the 2022 ceremony, when they wrote: ‘@BRITs is getting worse every year, Mo Gilligan is irritating and the acts they have on are shocking.’ Mo simply quoted the old message, before writing his own post that read: ‘Catch Me hosting this years @BRITs Live at the @TheO2 tonight at 8:30pm on @ITV & @ITVX 🙌🏾.’ Now that’s how you do it. The Brit Awards 2023 airs tonight from 8.30pm on ITV and ITVX. Got a story?
