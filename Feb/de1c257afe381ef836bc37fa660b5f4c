Pep Guardiola lauded Harry Kane for becoming Tottenham’s all-time top goalscorer and shared his thoughts on the Premier League title race after Manchester City’s defeat to Spurs on Sunday. City blew the chance to cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the table after the Gunners lost to Everton on Saturday as Kane’s goal secured a 1-0 win over Guardiola’s side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. That goal saw him overtake Jimmy Greaves as Spurs’ all-time top scorer and Guardiola was quick to congratulate the England international striker – who City tried to sign four times in the summer of 2021. ‘Big congratulations, he deserves it, he is an exceptional player – on behalf of Manchester City I congratulate him,’ Guardiola said. Quizzed about the title race, with this weekend’s results meaning Arsenal hold onto their five-point lead over City with a game in hand, Guardiola added: ‘We are not in the position to think about being champions. ‘Just the next game, Aston Villa, we will prepare well and play our game as best as possible. ‘It is football, they (Arsenal) drop [points] and there was a good opportunity but we knew how difficult it was in this stadium.’ Sunday’s result means City have lost all five of their matches against Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, failing to score a single goal despite having 84 shot attempts. ‘Sooner or later it is going to change, but it is strange we haven’t scored one goal, we have missed penalties in the past,’ Guardiola said. ‘To find an explanation is not easy. ‘We found the positions, made good balls to the channels, but missed the last action up front. ‘Tottenham has a fantastic team and squad and they punish you. They have a lot of quality up front and don’t need much with transitions, set pieces, give a lot of credit to them.’ MORE : Kyle Walker warns Arsenal over 'twists and turns' in Premier League title race MORE : Jamie Carragher makes Premier League title prediction after Man City and Arsenal both lose
