Kate Middleton stepped out in a recycled Alexander McQueen white gown at last night’s Baftas – a dress she previously debuted at the 2019 event. The Princess of Wales teamed the white bridal dress with elegant black satin gloves, for a contrasting aesthetic. But perhaps the most surprising element to this outfit was a certain high street accessory. Kate wore some statement Zara floral earrings, which come in at just £18. ‘This time, it has cascading shoulder embellishments,’ a Sky News presenter said, while discusing the outfit on air. ‘And her earrings, they’re floral chandelier earrings. Where are they from? Zara! Who would have guessed that? £18, Thomas the producer says.’ Naturally the earrings have already sold out via Zara online – but some people who already own them are seeing this as a lucrative opportunity. As a result, the cascading floral earrings have already been spotted on eBay for more than £100. In fact, two different sellers have posted the earrings at £109 and £110, respectively. For the event, the Princess of Wales was accompanied by husband Prince William, who is President of BAFTA. Be sure to check out all the other exceptional looks from the red carpet, too.
