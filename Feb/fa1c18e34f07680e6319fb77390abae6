Just over a week ago, Dan Walker revealed that he’d been involved in a terrifying collision on the road, when he was knocked off of his bike by a car. The Channel 5 presenter shared photos of his face looking heavily swollen, bruised and bloody, recalling how the paramedics told him that if he hadn’t been wearing a helmet, he might have not survived. In the days since, the 45-year-old has been sharing regular updates on his recovery with his followers on social media, showing the swelling going down and scrapes on his hand. However, in his latest post, Dan looks almost unrecognisable from how impacted his face was by his fall, appearing as though he could be back to normal extremely soon. Sharing a picture of himself with his dog Winnie, the former BBC broadcaster wrote that he’d been up and about today, going for a walk with his canine companion and having a haircut. ‘She’s much happier than she looks and smells gorgeous 😂,’ he said about Winnie, before adding: ‘Face coming on nicely. Hopefully back in business soon. Thanks for all your lovely messages.’ Several people were astounded by how quickly Dan’s face has been recovering since his accident. ‘The body is an amazing thing! Look how quickly you have healed! 🙌,’ one person commented on Instagram. ‘Wow, what a difference a week makes, great news 👏,’ another wrote. When Dan first opened up about the incident, he recollected how surprised he was to find out that he hadn’t broken any bones. In a recent article written for The Times, the TV personality said that he felt ‘confident’ that he wasn’t to blame for the crash, while assuring the ‘distressed’ driver involved in the accident that he was doing ok. ‘I can’t go into details at the moment because the police might take another week or so to publish their report but, after talking to Conor (a police officer), I am confident that I am not to blame and I hope this can be resolved outside the courts,’ he wrote. ‘I know I could have died but I also know how easy it is to make a mistake, even when you’re trying to be careful. ‘I can’t really remember what they (the driver) looked like, from that moment they were looking over me as I came round, but I do recall that they looked deeply distressed and I imagine it is all they are thinking about at the moment.’ Got a story?
