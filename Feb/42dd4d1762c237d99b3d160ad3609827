Most of us love travelling, but the actual getting from A to B part in a metal cabin 36,000ft in the air? Not so much. From delays to annoying seat neighbours, we all have stories of unpleasant trips journeying through the world – but it’s not all sunshine and rainbows for cabin crew either. One flight attendant asked fellow colleagues what their pet peeves were when it came to dealing with passengers during their shift, and their responses were eye-opening. Jay Roberts, who has worked as senior cabin crew for Emirates, posted on his Facebook page – A Fly Guy’s Crew Network, asking other flight attendants what grinds their gears. Among the top irks were people who don’t say hello when they’re being greeted while embarking, those who decide to use the bathroom just as they’re being served food, and handing all the stacked rubbish together at the end of the flight. Some of the complaints included ‘passengers who insist on telling me their seat number during boarding’, meanwhile another wrote: ‘I hate it when they tap or touch me to get my attention’. Another added: ‘When they queue to get off as soon as the plane has touched down’, while a fellow flight attendant added: ‘When someone opens the overhead bin during the flight to take out something and doesn’t close it’. Parents onboard can also display not-so-pleasant behaviours including ‘changing nappies then handing me their bio-hazard diapers [nappies]’. Other gross habits included walking to the toilet barefoot and talking to cabin crew while eating. Some things to think about next time you take to the skies. Do you have a story you want to share?
