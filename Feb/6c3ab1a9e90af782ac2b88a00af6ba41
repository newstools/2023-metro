Ricky Gervais weighed in on the Roald Dahl editing debate and poked fun at ‘fragile’ people. Changes made to the classics by publishers Puffin sparked heated conversations after words like ‘fat’ were removed from the original stories. Speaking out on Friday, the organisation then announced the release of the Roald Dahl Classic Collection ‘to keep the author’s classic texts in print’ amid reassurance they had ‘listened to the debate’. Ricky, 61, decided to share his own opinions on the matter and took to Twitter to wade in on the debate over the storybooks. He poked fun at the editing on Friday and described people as ‘fragile’ and ‘easily offended’. The comedian – known for his outspokenness – then pondered over whether his own stand-up shows would be altered to remove swear words and words like ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ to appear more politically correct after his death. Above a black and white photo of the funnyman staring into space with a quizzical look on his face, Ricky penned a long message nodding to the Roald Dahl controversy. He wrote: ‘This is me pondering whether they’ll change any of the words I’ve used in my work after I’m dead, to spare those who are fragile and easily offended. ‘Words like ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’. And ‘c**t’ and ‘f**k’. And ‘fat, ugly, greedy, pathetic little stupid f***ing c**t’. Stuff like that. [sic]’. Hours later, he posted another photo of exposing his stomach and typed: ‘I’ve changed my mind. I think we should ban the words ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’. No reason. [sic]’. Followers were quick to respond to the star’s antics and left their own opinions underneath his tweets in their thousands. One wrote: ‘They will just ban your stuff and it will become contraband for the few that still like to laugh,’ while another noted: ‘I can’t wait for my kids to get a bit older to introduce your work to them. It will be a great day. I know they will love you too!!! [sic]’. However not all were happy with Ricky’s words as a fan posted: ‘You don’t play to children. Surely you see the difference. Think about reading a book to a child (I have little grandchildren) having to change the words yourself or explain to the child why s/he shouldn’t use hurtful words to people, particularly other children. Hard stuff [sic]’. Metro.co.uk contacted Ricky’s reps for comment. Got a story?
