The Glazer family are unwilling to sell Manchester United for the prices on offer following bids from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani. Offers for the club were submitted by Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim last week, though the bids made were only ‘indicative’. Those offers are expected to be firmed up in the next stage of the process, which interested parties hope to happen this week as the Raine Group have taken time to consider bids for the club. Both Jassim and Ratcliffe are seeking full control of the club, though the latter is simply looking to buy out the Glazers’ 70% share of the club. There’s therefore a separation between the two bids, but both parties’ offers of around £4bn take into account that they’ll be taking on £680m worth of debt that the Glazers have saddled the club with. That would be above United’s share price value of around £3.5bn but it’s nowhere near the Glazers’ asking price of £5bn. The Telegraph claim the Americans are therefore not willing to sell for the current prices on offer and interested parties must signifcantly raise their bids if they’re to get their hands on the club. The process is expected to progress this week, with the Raine Group likely to give interested parties further insight to the club’s finances so that they can build a bigger picture of the club. This could help the likes of Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim to increase their offers but there is a fear that the Glazers want to simply raise investment and do not want to relinquish control of the club.
