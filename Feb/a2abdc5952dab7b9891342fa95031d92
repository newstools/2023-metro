Eddie Hearn has made a fresh prediction for Jake Paul’s clash with Tommy Fury in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. The boxing promoter was quizzed about the upcoming bout between the brother of Tyson Fury and YouTube star Paul, which is likely to pull in a huge audience. Paul and Fury faced the media on Thursday with an ‘all or nothing’ bet made between the duo over the fight purse. Fury was rumoured to have broken a sparring partner’s jaw ahead of the showdown and Hearn thinks he could get the job done in the first round. ‘I’ve had a massive U-turn on this fight,’ Hearn said in an interview with iFL TV on Friday. ‘When I watched the press conference yesterday, I thought to myself that Jake Paul didn’t look comfortable. ‘If Tommy Fury is aggressive in this fight from the first bell, there is absolutely no way he can’t win this fight. ‘Jake has really improved. Before, I was thinking that neither of them were great but that Jake Paul would win. ‘But I’ve thinking about it and when you analyse it sensibly… Tommy is fairly limited as a professional fighter but he has been doing it for most of his life. He knows how to punch correctly. If he is aggressive, if he puts it on Jake Paul and if he backs him up… it doesn’t go to two rounds. You will see on Sunday. ‘If Tommy Fury, who has been boxing for 10-12 years, if he can’t beat Jake Paul then honestly it is genuinely embarrassing for him. If he goes on the front foot from the first bell, the fight will not go to two rounds.’ MORE : Tyson Fury reveals £100,000 bet on Jake Paul vs Tommy Fury MORE : Why Jake Paul and Tommy Fury hate each other and how their feud got started
