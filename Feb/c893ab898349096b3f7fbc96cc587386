Christian Eriksen is hoping to feature for Manchester United before the end of the season after watching from the stands as his team-mates lifted the Carabao Cup. The Dane suffered an ankle injury in United’s FA Cup victory against Reading in January, that left him requiring surgery. Initial assessments suggested Eriksen would be out for up to four months, meaning he would return in mid-May. Eriksen was a frustrated onlooker as United got their hands on the League Cup and in doing so, ending their six-year trophy drought. United are still battling in the Premier League, while they’re through to the fifth round of the FA Cup and the last-16 of the Europa League. And Eriksen says he’s hopeful that he can feature again this season, particularly if United reach another final. ‘I’m feeling well,’ Eriksen told MUTV at Wembley.‘I mean it’s always boring to be in the boot and being on crutches but I’ve left the crutches now and am only on the boot. ‘Next week, it should be gone and I’ll be finally learning to walk! No, it feels good. Asked if he still hopes to play in a final this season, Eriksen said: ‘Yeah, definitely. Before it was four but it’s now three and we’ve taken one. But there are so many games in between, before the next final. There will be a longer build-up if we get there. ‘For me, there’s a lot of hard work coming back, getting my place back in the team, as I mean the team is performing and the guys are winning. So it’s a pleasure to watch.’ MORE : Chelsea must avoid ‘stupid’ decision to sell Mason Mount to Man Utd or Liverpool, says Emmanuel Petit MORE : Graham Potter blames Todd Boehly’s reckless spending for ‘undermining’ Chelsea training For more stories like this, check our sport page.
