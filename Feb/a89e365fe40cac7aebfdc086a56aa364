Erik ten Hag says that Anthony Martial has hit a ‘setback’ in his recovery from injury which has forced him to miss Manchester United’s clash against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Martial had only just returned from his latest injury setback in United’s last game – coming off the bench to score in the Carabao Cup semi-final win against Nottingham Forest last Wednesday. The forward was expected to back on the bench for the league game at Old Trafford against the Eagles, but when the line-ups were announced the 27-year-old was nowhere to be seen. And fans’ worst fears have been confirmed as Ten Hag revealed that Martial had suffered a ‘setback’ in his recovery and was not fit enough to make the match day squad. ‘He had a set back from the game when he returned,’ the manager told MUTV ahead of kick-off. ‘He dropped a little bit back. We have to wait, we have to be patient, not force it.’ Martial’s injury problems have managed to hit a new high in 2022/23, as this is his fifth separate injury absence of the season already, with the Palace clash being the 20th game of the campaign he’s been unavailable for. United’s XI was as many expected, with Fred taking Christian Eriksen’s place in midfield while deadline day signing Marcel Sabitzer was named on the bench. Meanwhile Patrick Vieira has made two changes from the Palace team that held United to a 1-1 draw just 17 days ago, with Wilfried Zaha and Jean-Philippe Mateta dropping out for Jordan Ayew and Jeffrey Schlupp. Former United forward Zaha was ruled out ahead of the weekend after it was confirmed he had suffered a hamstring injury.
