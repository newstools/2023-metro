A rugby star has issued a public apology after being filmed performing a sex act down a public alleyway with a woman who is not his wife. Joe Westerman got embroiled in a sex scandal after a video showing him cheating on his wife was shared on Twitter. The dad-of-three was said to be the man in the viral clip, which is believed to have been filmed by a passer-by. But his wife Lauren today insisted she is not the mystery woman in the footage under now deleted posts on Twitter. ‘Can I make this VERY clear that this is NOT me!’ she wrote. ‘We have three children one of whom is almost 15 and she does not need to see things like this all over social media!’ Castleford Tigers confirmed earlier today they were investigating the raunchy clip. Mr Westerman has now been issued ‘a substantial fine and will also be required to undertake community service to educate young people on the effects of alcohol’. The club said he is ‘incredibly remorseful for his actions’ in the video. A statement from the player issued by Castleford Tigers said: ‘Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly apologise to my family and friends for my actions. ‘I would also like to apologise to the supporters, sponsors, staff, and directors of Castleford Tigers as well as my teammates. ‘I would like to extend this apology to the game of rugby league, and I have realised that I need to work on my decision-making around alcohol.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
