Molly-Mae Hague has given fans a glimpse inside her blissful first week with baby daughter Bambi. The Love Island star, 23, sent the internet into meltdown this week when she announced that she and boyfriend Tommy Fury, also 23, had welcomed their first child on January 23. Molly-Mae and Tommy – who met on the 2019 series of the ITV dating show – later shared that their little girl had a Disney-inspired name, offering a peek at her chic nursery with a cute Instagram snap. Now, the PrettyLittleThing creative director has proven that her tot is already the most spoilt child around, as she was welcomed home by a load of balloons and personalised decorations in the family-of-three’s home. She also confirmed that she had a natural birth, promising fans that she’ll give more details soon on what is officially her ‘biggest and best achievement’. Sharing a slew of snaps from their dreamy first few days together, influencer Molly-Mae told her 7.1million followers that she’s well and truly living in a love bubble. ‘Taking pics of absolutely everything so we NEVER forget these days. 😭’, the new mum wrote on Instagram. The snaps she shared included one of their first days at home together, with Molly-Mae cradling Bambi and kissing her forehead, with a bunch of pink ‘welcome home baby girl’ balloons and bouquet of roses in the background – Molly-Mae later confirmed the snap was taken just two hours after she gave birth. Molly-Mae also showed off some personalised decorations for her newborn, having installed a sign reading, ‘Welcome to the world, Princess Fury’ inside her mansion. The artwork also featured purple illustrations of castles and a cloud archway. Other snaps included Molly-Mae cuddling her little one inside her room, with a framed drawing of Disney deer Bambi on the wall. Also documenting their precious moments in hospital just hours after giving birth, Molly-Mae took polaroids of Bambi sound asleep, while new dad Tommy kissed her head. It’s safe to say the new parents are absolutely besotted, boasting sweet smiles in every photo as they create memories with their bundle of joy. Fans and famous pals were also in love with the adorable snaps, with Molly-Mae’s sister Zoe commenting that she was ‘bursting with joy’. ‘Oh bless you , i wish you all the happiness in the world 💕’, commented one fan. ‘You’re going to be the best mommy!!’, one added. Another added: ‘😭my heart!!!! The cutest photos ever. I’m obsessed ✨✨’ However, despite being showered with love, Molly-Mae was also met with criticism from followers who seemed concerned for her child’s safety, after seeing how she was sitting in her car seat in the photos. ‘Lovely photos 😍, just to let you know snow suits should never be used in a car seat. 🚗 I didn’t know when i first had my boy but they’re actually very dangerous. ❤️❤️’, one penned. ‘The 9th picture… Bambi isn’t in her car seat properly, she shouldn’t have the pram suit on, as as you can see, she isn’t safe in it as the straps are way to baggy. ❤️’, advised another. This isn’t the first time the social media star has received criticism over her parenting in the short time her daughter has been in the world. Cruel trolls recently targeted her for the way she carried Bambi in a video of her arriving home from the hospital. Molly-Mae held her daughter close to her body, ensuring that her hand supported the back of the baby’s neck as she stepped onto the ground. On the website for baby product company Pampers, it states that the ‘most important step when carrying or holding your newborn is to support your baby’s head and neck at all times’, as babies don’t develop head control until they’re around four months old. And while Molly-Mae was holding Bambi securely, some people still felt the need to blast her technique, with one commenting on Instagram: ‘Omg she stepped out of vehicle without holding her tiny head and neck.’ Got a story?
