Mysterious containers found floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean turned out to be full of cocaine worth £261,000,000. Just over three tonnes of coke – which could have ‘serviced’ Australia for a year – was dropped in the water by an international smuggling gang, it is believed. Police in New Zealand have now destroyed the drugs. The mammoth seizure would have dealt a significant financial blow to everyone involved, from the South American producers all the way to the distributors. New Zealand police commissioner Andrew Coster said the cocaine was dropped at a floating transit point in 81 bales before a navy ship intercepted it last week. He said: ‘We believe there was enough cocaine to service the Australian market for about one year and this would be more than New Zealand would use in 30 years.’ Bill Perry, the acting comptroller of the New Zealand Customs Service, said the haul illustrates the lengths gangs go to smuggle drugs across the South Pacific. He said: ‘We see perhaps this is just an indication that the transnational organised crime groups are testing the market in different ways, so as agencies we need to collaborate.’ A drug cartel which supplies a third of Europe’s cocaine was recently busted with 30 tonnes of drugs worth £2.7 billion. The European Union crime agency confirmed 49 suspects were hunted down, including six ‘high-value’ targets in Dubai. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
