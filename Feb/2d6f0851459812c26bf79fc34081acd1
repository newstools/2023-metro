A woman has shared the incredible moment her baby bump completely changed shape. TikTok user Elliyah-Jade (@elliyahjade) posted the video online to show her bump making some powerful movements. To caption the clip, she wrote: ‘Exposing myself here. But what the f**k was my kid doing in there back then.’ The short, seven-second clip shows the bottom of Elliyah-Jade’s bump protruding outwards – more than is usual for an average bump. However, then the top half suddenly jerks upwards to flatten it out. The way the baby was sitting and moving around in Elliyah-Jade’s womb led many viewers to offer opinions on the sex of the baby. Some were wholly convinced. ‘I felt that. It’s a boy,’ wrote one user, while another commented: ‘Congratulations it’s a boy.’ There’s no evidence that a baby’s placement in the womb can predict its gender, but a commonly-believed myth that a bump that’s lower down indicates a boy. It seems TikTok was right this time though, as Elliyah-Jade has since given birth to a beautiful and healthy baby boy. Baby movement in the womb is a very healthy sign during pregnancy. According to the NHS website, you should start to feel your baby move ‘around 16 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.’ These actions can feel like a ‘gentle swirling or fluttering.’ As a pregnancy progresses, some women will feel ‘kicks and jerky movements.’ If you have not felt your baby move by 24 weeks, or there is a change to your baby’s usual pattern of movements, you should contact your midwife immediately.
