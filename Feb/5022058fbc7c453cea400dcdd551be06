Vanessa Hudgens is set to walk down the aisle after reportedly getting engaged to boyfriend Cole Tucker. The former High School Musical actress has been dating the MLB player since late 2020 when they first went public with their relationship. It’s now claimed that Cole, 26, proposed to Vanessa, 34, some time at the end of 2022, with the couple choosing to keep the news private. According to TMZ, it’s not known when he popped the question but the couple did enjoy a romantic trip to Paris in November, so it wouldn’t be out of the realm for him to get down on one knee in the city of love. They certainly seem smitten with each other, as Vanessa posted a cute Instagram photo of her gazing at Cole with a wide smile at a party. ‘I’ll stop the world and melt with you ❤️🥰,’ she captioned the snap last week. Vanessa and Cole were first linked together in November 2020 and the Princess Switch actress recently revealed how they first met. ‘He’s just kind of perfect for me,’ she told Entertainment Tonight. ‘Me and Cole met on a Zoom meditation group. Very random, yes. Zoom, you’ve got to love it. ‘I think that it’s also so important to stay grateful for everything that you have in life. ‘I’ve been making that a priority, and I feel like it’s just been making magic happen all the more,’ she said. Vanessa’s romance with Cole blossomed months after her split from ex-boyfriend Austin Butler at the beginning of 2020. Austin recently gave the actress credit for him taking on the role of late rock n roll legend Elvis Presley in the critically acclaimed biopic Elvis, which has earned him a best actor Oscar nomination. In her younger years, Vanessa enjoyed a high-profile romance with her High School Musical co-star Zac Efron and actor Josh Hutcherson. Metro.co.uk has reached out to Vanessa’s reps for comment.
