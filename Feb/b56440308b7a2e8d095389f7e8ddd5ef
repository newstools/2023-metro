Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has fired a dig at Manchester United following their success in the Carabao Cup. Erik ten Hag secured the first trophy of his reign at Old Trafford as United beat Newcastle 2-0 in Sunday’s final at Wembley. United remain in contention to add to their trophy haul this season as they are still in the FA Cup and the Europa League, while they sit eight points behind Arsenal in the Premier League table. But Guardiola has cheekily joked that United may need to spend more in order to secure more silverware. ‘Congratulations to United,’ said Guardiola. ‘Sooner or later it should happen, shouldn’t it? Welcome.’ When asked if he considers United as challengers for more trophies, Guardiola replied with a grin: ‘If they spend a little more money, yes, because they didn’t spend, isn’t it? ‘They’re in the position they normally should be.’ Despite his tongue-in-cheek comment, Guardiola also praised Ten Hag for doing ‘an incredible job’ at United. ‘I remember when we travelled to win our first Carabao Cup, everyone was so excited to do it,’ Guardiola said ‘For the staff it was new, for the players it was new. When we travelled there to win the Carabao Cup for the fourth time in a row, it was like, ‘well, it’s OK, another one, another day in the office’. ‘It’s normal that United has to be there. When I landed here, I thought United would always be there, for the history, for everything, and Erik is doing an incredible job. ‘And the players, you see how committed they are, how all together they try to do it.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
