Dame Prue Leith was left blushing after her husband John made some racy comments about their sex life. The 82-year-old joined Loose Women stars Janet Street-Porter, Denise Welch, Ruth Langsford and Gloria Hunniford while her partner was sat in the live audience. Discussing recent news about a hormone injection that could help treat low sex drive, the conversation soon turned towards libidos, with Dame Prue being asked some pretty personal questions. Dame Prue began by dismissing the ‘nonsense’ surrounding people not talking about their libidos, saying: ‘Your libido is really part of what makes you happy’. The panellists then turned to John for the truth about their relationship. ‘If Prue wanted that injection John, what do you think?’ Ruth asked. The husband of The Great British Bake Off judge replied: ‘Oh don’t give her more!’ ‘You can’t stand the pace John,’ Ruth joked. As the audience were left in hysterics, he added that he’d have to ‘call in reinforcements’ if Dame Prue’s sex drive were any higher. ‘That’s really refreshing, because people normally cringe,’ Ruth replied, while Denise noted how trolls on Twitter respond with ‘green sick emojis’ to older women speaking about their sex drive. ‘As if we should never, ever discuss it,’ Denise said. Loose Women airs weekdays from 12.30pm on ITV. Got a story?
