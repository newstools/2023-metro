Screwfix millionaire James Goddard-Watts’s ex-wife has won the latest leg of a 13-year divorce battle over money. Julia Goddard-Watts appealed against a High Court ruling that she said left her £7.4million from her former husband’s fortune of more than £80million. Top judges have now found that Mr Goddard-Watts fraudulently failed to disclose assets to such an extent that the ‘entire financial landscape’ of the case needs to be re-examined. Mrs Goddard-Watts’s lawyer Ros Bever said her client was disappointed she would have to face more litigation. But she added: ‘She is delighted the Court of Appeal has endorsed her view that repeated frauds are not a matter which the court should overlook.’ The couple in their 50s got married in 1996 and split in 2009. A settlement was reached a year later that required Mr Goddard-Watts, whose family founded DIY chain Screwfix before it was sold to Kingfisher, to hand his ex £4million and a £3.25million house. In 2016 and 2019 she won extra cash after complaining he had hidden assets. And last year she was awarded another £1.1million because he had not revealed the potential value of a deal he was involved in. The Court of Appeal has now ruled his ‘fraudulent non-disclosure’ was ‘so far-reaching’ that the judge involved needs to begin again.
