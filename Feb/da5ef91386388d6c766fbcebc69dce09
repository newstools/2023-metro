Eamonn Holmes arrived at Wembley stadium by wheelchair to watch his beloved football team Manchester United beat Newcastle United to take home the Carabao Cup. A devastating fall down 18 stairs in October last year along with pre-existing back problems has left the presenter reliant on ‘a frame, crutches or a wheelchair to get around’. The accident came as the 63-year-old was recovering from surgery on his back, and the impact on the hard floor of his Surrey mansion caused his shoulder to break. From 2006 until August 2021, Eamonn co-hosted This Morning with his wife Ruth Langsford, but joined GB News in 2021. The star currently hosts a weekday morning programme on the channel called Breakfast with Eamonn and Isabel. Eamonn told the Daily Mail of the fall: ‘Ruth came rushing down the stairs. She kept saying, “You’re fine, everything’s okay, you’re fine.” I said, “Ruthie, there is a bone sticking out of my shoulder – I’m not fine.”’ ‘I would give anything just to be able to walk my dog or play a round of golf like I used to,’ confessed the presenter earlier this year. Today, the TV personality was spotted arriving into Wembley in a wheelchair with his eldest son, 34-year-old Declan. Eamonn rested his coat on his lap and held some crutches as he made his way to the match, which saw his beloved team Manchester United beat Newcastle United 2-0 in what was a tense 90 minutes. The broadcaster took to social media to mark the day, which also happened to be his third son Jack’s big 21st birthday, who he also said was attending the match. Alongside a picture of Eamonn and Declan, he wrote: ‘At Wembley for #carabaocup final with Number 1 Son. Number 3 Son here too on his 21st birthday 🎂. Let’s hope he gets the present we all want🏆. #manchesterunited.’ This comes after the GB News host said he thought it was ‘absolutely’ a hard time to be a white man in his sixties when asked the question by podcaster Kaye Adams earlier this month. ‘No one’s interested in casting you, no one’s interested in planning a programme around you, no one’s interested in your experience,’ Eamonn responded. He continued: ‘You do not tick the right boxes for them in terms of your sexuality, your ethnicity. ‘You’re bottom of the list, I think, when it comes to choices.’ Eamonn is a famously devoted Manchester United supporter, and once posted a picture of himself working from home during the pandemic from an office which looked to be clad with memorabilia of the team.
