Manchester United star Anthony Martial has been put up for sale as Erik ten Hag looks to sign a world class striker this summer. The Frenchman has failed to complete 90 minutes this season and he’s scored just six times in an injury-hit campaign. Martial made a comeback from injury in the 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest last Wednesday but was missing from the squad that beat Crystal Palace three days later as he suffered another injury setback. Ten Hag is a fan of Martial and feels United’s attack link-up best with the Frenchman at its tip. However, Martial has shown he cannot be relied on this season and the club pushed to sign Wout Weghorst on loan in January. With Ten Hag set to have limited funds this summer, United know they must raise funds to sign a top centre forward and central midfielder. The Manchester Evening News say Martial will be a victim of the club’s finances and he’s been put up for sale in a bid to raise revenue. Harry Maguire, Alex Telles and Anthony Elanga are other players likely to leave. Frenkie de Jong, the Barcelona midfielder, remains Ten Hag’s priority target in midfield but the Dutchman has enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance at the Camp Nou this season.
