Richard Gere has been released from hospital after contracting pneumonia, it has been reported. The Pretty Woman actor had been enjoying a holiday with his family in Mexico when he is said to have fallen ill. Over the past week, Richard, 73, and his wife Alejandra Silva have been celebrating her 40th birthday while staying near Nuevo Vallarta with their children – Alexander, four, and a two-year-old son. However, the Hollywood icon reportedly developed a bad cough which persisted during the trip, and progressed to the point he had to check himself into a hospital. Richard was then diagnosed with pneumonia, according to TMZ, and received treatment during an overnight stay. The Runaway Bride star showed signs of improvement the following day and was reportedly discharged from hospital with a round of antibiotics, and is said to be doing better. On Thursday, Alejandra revealed their entire family had been struck down with an illness, but it’s not known if it was similar to Richard’s. She shared an Instagram post with a photo of her walking across a beach holding hands with her two sons on either side. The caption read: ‘Thank you all for the birthday wishes.. after almost 3 weeks of everyone being sick in our family today finally I feel much better! Thank you for all the love ❤️ I give it all back to you! 💫 #happybirthday #happy40.’ Richard married Alejandra, a Spanish publicist and activist, in April 2018 with an Indian-inspired wedding on the actor’s ranch in upstate New York. Speaking after the nuptials, Richard told Hello! Magazine: ‘I’m the happiest man in the universe. How could I not be? ‘I’m married to a beautiful woman who is smart, sensitive, committed to helping people, who’s fun, patient, who knows how to forgive, who’s a great cook – and who makes the best salads in the world!’ He added: ‘Alejandra meditates, she’s a vegetarian, a great mother, has the touch of an angel and she’s also Spanish – the land of kings and queens, of Cervantes and Bunuel. You can’t get any better than that.’ The two met when Richard stayed at one of the hotels owned by Alejandra’s family in Positano, Italy in 2014. Since then, they’ve maintained a private life and have not revealed the name of their youngest son, born in 2020. Metro.co.uk has reached out to Richard’s rep for comment. Got a story?
