A man received an official letter notifying him that he was dead – and telling him he needs a doctor’s note to prove he’s alive. Mark Cusack, 48, says the bizarre letter from the Department of Work and Pensions has left him with no National Insurance number. The former town councillor, who lives alone with his dog Puggles in Hungerford, Berkshire, claims the town hall was even informed of his ‘demise’ – leaving him unable to pay council tax. Despite seeing the ‘funny side’ to the experience, he’s now even had to get a letter from his GP confirming that he is, in fact, still alive. The letter, on The Hungerford Surgery headed notepaper, states: ‘I am writing as the above gentleman’s General Practitioner. ‘I can confirm I consulted with him today in person and that he is alive.’ Mark said: ‘She joked that I should consider cashing in any life insurance I might have. ‘I’ve reported the matter to Action Fraud, given that I’ve had a previous issue of identity theft. ‘The current situation may seem farcical but it has many ramifications. ‘I really wouldn’t want anyone else to be faced with a situation where they’re suddenly “deceased,” especially not someone with a health condition or who is in a vulnerable situation. ‘Unfortunately, reversing everything is not as simple as making a phone call or writing a letter.’ The DWP has been approached for a comment.
