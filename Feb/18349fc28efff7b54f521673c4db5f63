Arsenal and Aston Villa staff were involved in a heated altercation in the closing stages of the Gunners’ 4-2 win at Villa Park on Saturday. Arsenal’s first-team coach and analyst Miguel Molina and Villa analysts Victor Manas and Jaime Arias needed to be separated in the press area after the Villa pair were unhappy with Molina’s celebrations after Emiliano Martinez’s own goal in the third minute of injury time. Molina was subsequently ejected from the press area with Arias and Manas, who worked at Arsenal during Unai Emery’s reign, both furious with the Spanish coach. Following Martinez’s own goal which put Arsenal 3-2 in front, Gabriel Martinelli then scored a counter attack to complete a 4-2 win for the Gunners to put them back in top spot in the Premier League. When asked about the incident, Mikel Arteta said after the game: ‘Like anything that happens in the stands, we will look at it and address it and take action if necessary.’ When asked about the bust-up, Emery said: ‘No I didn’t see it but I’m going to ask about it.’ Describing the incident at Villa Park, journalist Ashley Preece told Birmingham Live: ‘It happened right after Martinez’s own goal as Arsenal made it 3-2 in stoppage time. ‘Victor Manas was raging, likewise Jaime Arias. It was clear that the Villa coaches were not happy with the manner in which Molina had celebrated and it became really heated. Molina was thrown out by the Villa Park steward just above the press box in the Trinity Road Stand. ‘Molina was shouting towards Arias, who was being held back. Manas wasn’t happy. It was a massive bust-up.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
