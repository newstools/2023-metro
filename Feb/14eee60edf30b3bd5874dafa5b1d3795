Thomas Muller admits he was ‘surprised’ by Marcel Sabitzer’s loan move to Manchester United but insists the midfielder’s career at Bayern Munich is not over. United were forced to make a late move in the January transfer window after Christian Eriksen was ruled out until late April with an ankle injury and the club moved quickly to reach an agreement with Bayern for Sabitzer. The Austria international has joined on loan for the remainder of the campaign, while United do not have a purchase option as part of their deal with Bayern. Sabitzer struggled for playing time at Bayern this season, starting just seven games in the Bundesliga, but Muller believes his teammate still has a future with the German club. ‘The team was surprised,’ Muller told Kicker about Sabitzer’s late move to United. ‘It happened very quickly. I’m happy for Sabi that he’s moving to Manchester United, getting the chance to play there. Manchester are a huge name.’ ‘He’ll be back in the summer. The chapter isn’t over yet.’ Muller also added that Sabitzer is ‘a cool guy and a great player’. Speaking about his move to United earlier this week, Sabitzer said: ‘Sometimes in life you have to make quick and important decisions ‘From the moment I heard about this opportunity I knew it was right for me. I am a competitive player; I want to win and help the club achieve its aims this season. ‘I feel that I am at my peak as a player, and that I can contribute a lot of experience and energy to the squad. I am excited to start with my new team-mates and manager and to show my qualities to Manchester United fans.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
