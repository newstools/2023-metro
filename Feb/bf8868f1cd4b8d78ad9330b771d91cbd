A man who wanted an early-morning snack after a night of drinking has been banned from driving. Liam Smith, 20, was spotted on his step-mum’s three-wheel e-scooter with a woman on the back at 4am on January 14. He was then seen staggering into a branch of McDonald’s in the Three Counties Retail Park in Malvern, Worcestershire, by police officers called out to another incident. They breathalysed him and he was found to be three times over the drink-driving limit. Smith’s pursuit for a McMuffin has left him with a two-year driving ban and fines totalling £412. Prosecutor Fatima Yasmin said: ‘Police were called to McDonald’s in Three Counties Retail Park on January 14 this year at around 4am in the morning to an unrelated incident. ‘While there police observed Smith driving the three wheel bike towards them at high speed. A female passenger was on the back. Neither were wearing a helmet. It came to a sudden stop. ‘When Smith got off the bike he was unsteady on his feet, so police followed him into the fast food restaurant.’ The court heard Smith, who hopes to train as a soldier, had taken his step-mum’s mobility e-scooter after getting hungry following a night of heavy drinking. Sam Lamsdale, defending, said: ‘It wasn’t an e-scooter often driven by people of his age, but his step-mother’s mobility aid bike he had permission to drive. ‘The vehicle had no number plates but if it had he would have realised driving it on roads after drinking alcohol would mean he was committing an offence. ‘If he had realised it was a criminal offence he wouldn’t have parked next to a marked police vehicle. ‘This is a young man who has never been in trouble before.’ Chairman of the bench Chris Mitchell said: ‘If you are going to join the Army you need to think about your actions.’ Things could have gone a lot worse for Smith if he took the same actions as this driver who smashed up a McDonald’s in a bigger vehicle than his step-mum’s mobility scooter.
