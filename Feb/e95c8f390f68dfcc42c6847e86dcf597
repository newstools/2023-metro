A couple of long-lost siblings have finally met each other after 40 years thanks to Facebook. Jason Dyke, 46, flew from his home in Brisbane, Australia, to Sussex over the weekend to meet half-sister Debbie Steele, 51, for the first time. The pair share the same dad but Jason never got the chance to meet Debbie after moving to Brisbane aged 18 months. But he didn’t give up hope and joined a Facebook group called Brighton People and put up a post appealing for information. The social media gods were clearly listening as they were soon reunited and began Facetiming one another. Recalling the moment he saw Debbie for the first time, Jason told Sussex Live: ‘I was absolutely flabbergasted and taken aback by it. ‘When I first saw her I was dumbfounded. I thought, “Oh my goodness, this is real, she is here.”‘ Jason said he had to move ‘heaven and earth’ to find Debbie after it became a ‘taboo subject’ that his dad had another child. Despite being separated for so long, there was no awkwardness when they met and everything felt natural. Debbie said: ‘I turned up and he looked at me, looked away and then looked back at me, I think he was in shock. ‘I was on cloud nine when I met him, I was nervous but so happy. We talk every day and on Wednesday we are meeting up to stay in Brighton for a couple of days to get to know each other.’ While Jason still lives in Australia, he plans to stay in Sussex until November and could permanently move back. Debbie said she ‘cant wait’ to see her sibling more and thanked the community for their help tracking him down. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
