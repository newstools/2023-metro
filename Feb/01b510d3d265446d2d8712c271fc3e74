Blake Lively fans reckon the actress has given birth… and the cogs in our brains are turning. The Gossip Girl star, 35, announced last year that she and husband Ryan Reynolds, 46, were expecting their fourth child. The Hollywood stars are already parents to three daughters: James, eight; Inez, six; and three-year-old Betty. But, their brood appears to have grown once more… if we’re right to read into Blake’s latest social media post like everyone else is. Taking to Instagram ahead of the Super Bowl and Rihanna’s halftime extravaganza, the A Simple Favour star posted a picture with her hubby and his mother, Tammy. She captioned the post, which also featured snaps of some delish looking dishes: ‘Puppy Bowl Sunday 2023🥘 🍲 🥧 been busy.’ Now, the ‘been busy’ definitely alludes to something having happened, right? But that’s not the only thing, as fans quickly spotted that Blake did not have a big baby bump in the photo like she did the last time we saw her. Naturally, the comments section was alight with speculation, as one fan asked: ‘Wait did you have the baby?’ ‘She discreetly gives birth and then looks like this right afterwards in a tight shirt. She’s good at this. 😂’, another joked. One confused follower wrote: ‘Did I miss something. Where is the baby bump?’ A fellow detective penned: ‘I had to go back and look at the dates of pregnancy photos she posted. Timing seems right for the baby to be here already!’ Now, we will eagerly await any further news… Speaking ahead of their arrival, Deadpool star Ryan shared how his other children were feeling about having a younger sibling. He told Entertainment Tonight: ‘They’re in. They love it. They’re ready.’ ‘I’m very excited,’ he added. ‘We’d have to be. You know, you’d have to be a moron to do this four times if you didn’t like it. It’s gonna be nuts, but we’re very excited.’ Got a story?
