Quick-thinking locals sprang into action to help a woman trapped under the wheels of a 950kg Toyota Aygo. The victim was heard screaming as she tripped over a chain link fence into traffic in Guernsey. People who happened to be passing by rushed to help push the car on Monday afternoon. They put in all their efforts to lift it, as Nocq Road in St Sampson was brought to a standstill. The heavy vehicle was held up on one side, before emergency workers arrived on the scene.
