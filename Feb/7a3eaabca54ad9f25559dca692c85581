A group of Qatari investors are readying an enormous bid for Manchester United, which they believe will dwarf any other offers for the Premier League giants. The Glazer family, the current owners of the club, are looking to sell but have set a mid-February deadline for bids to come in and it appeared that a sale was unlikely before then. However, The Daily Mail report that a group of ‘private, high-wealth individuals’ from Qatar are prepared to make a huge offer in the coming days and are ready to give Erik ten Hag a vast transfer budget if they do take over the club. The Qatari group are not the only interested party, with Jim Ratcliffe making his intention to buy the club known. The Ineos billionaire, and one of Britain’s richest men, is a Manchester United fan and may be a preferable choice for some fans, but the offer from Qatar could be far bigger than his. Whoever buys Manchester United is going to have to come up with a mind-boggling amount of money, with the Glazers wanting around £6bn for the club. There is then going to be a huge bill to either redevelop Old Trafford or build a new stadium, along with the never-ending bill for new players every year. Those massive figures are not thought to be a concern for the Qataris, though. There could be issues for the group, though, with new owners needing Premier League approval and doubts will be held due to Qatar’s poor human rights record. However, Newcastle were bought by Saudi Arabian owners in 2021, catapulting them into Champions League challengers, with human rights concerns seemingly causing no issues.
