Ivan Toney is facing a lengthy ban after admitting to multiple breaches of the Football Association’s gambling rules. The Brentford striker has been charged with 262 alleged breaches of the FA’s gambling rules and MailOnline reports that the 26-year-old has pleaded guilty to ‘many’ of the charges but is contesting some of them. Toney’s alleged gambling breaches are said to have taken place between 2017 and 2021, before he began playing in the Premier League. It’s understood that an FA disciplinary hearing is imminent and Toney is now set to serve a suspension. Toney has scored 14 goals for Brentford in the Premier League this season and was in contention to be called up for England’s European Championship qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine next month. Toney is now likely to miss the remainder of the season, judging by the FA’s previous track record in dealing with similar incidents. In 2017, Joey Barton was suspended for 18 months after he admitted to placing 1260 bets between 2006 and 2013, although his ban was cut to 13 months following a successful appeal. In 2021, Boston United’s Andi Thanoj and Jay Rollins were banned for five months for placing 757 bets between them. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
