A security guard allegedly stabbed his boss to death for ‘making him work long hours and verbally abusing him’. Sawat Sriratchalao, 44, has been arrested after being accused of pulling out a 33cm knife on Arom Bunnan, 56. He was driven to launch the attack in central Bangkok after ‘bullying’ from his boss, it’s claimed. ‘’I have been angry at my boss for a long time. Sometimes I couldn’t sleep because I was so stressed thinking about him’, he reportedly told police after his arrest. ‘He bullied me and always spoke harshly to me. Even when I went home his words were in my head.’ CCTV is said to show Mr Bunnan beg for mercy at a car park in Lumpini Park on February 1. An attacker plunges a knife into his chest, before passers-by intervene and pry the two apart. The suspect is thought to have fled on his bike, while Mr Bunnan dropped to his knees. The victim was rushed to hospital, but died from a stab wound to the left side of his chest. Sriratchalao was detained after officers tracked him down at his home. He faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of murder. Thailand retains the death penalty for murder, but only carries it out sporadically. Furious worker Sriratchalao claims he was forced to work long hours, and endured frequent verbal abuse from Bunnan. Police Lieutenant Colonel Buddhawiro said: ‘The evidence shows that the suspect killed his boss with a knife. ‘He planned the attack, so prosecutors have made charges of murder for this case.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
