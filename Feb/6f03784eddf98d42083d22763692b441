London’s commuters have faced chaos over the past few months, as Transport for London (TfL) and rail strikes have caused huge disruption to travel, and more rail and bus strikes are on their way in 2023. As the cost of living crisis continues to bite, TfL has announced price hikes to its London Underground and bus services, which will come into force later this year. But just when will prices rise, and how much will they rise by? Here’s all you need to know. Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced that London’s Tube, bus, Overground, Elizabeth line, DLR and tram fares will jump by an average of 5.9% from March 5. Mr Khan said he was forced by the government to rise prices in line with the 5.9% national rail price rise. He said: ‘I froze TfL fares for five years from 2016 to make transport more affordable for millions of Londoners. But my hands have been tied since the pandemic by the strict conditions set by the government. ‘This is a challenging time for our city, with a government that is not fully funding our public services, but I’m determined to step up so that we can continue building a greener, safer and fairer London for everyone.’ Additionally, a ban introduced at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic on pensioners travelling for free on TfL services before 9am has been made permanent, a move which will generate an extra £40m a year in extra fares. On London Underground services, the Zone 1-6 TfL fares cap for contactless and Oyster cards will rise to £14.90 per day (up 80p) and £74.50 per week (up £4.20). The daily cap on Tube or rail travel in zones 1-4 will increase by 70p to £11.70. MORE : Are there any Tube strikes planned for February 2023?
