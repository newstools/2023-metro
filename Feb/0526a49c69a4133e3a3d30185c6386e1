Three teenagers have been arrested after a fourth teen was stabbed to death near Crawley railway station in West Sussex. Police were called to the scene, on the town’s Malthouse Road, just after 3.20pm today. An 18-year-old man was found with serious injuries, and despite the best efforts of members of the public and paramedics, he died at the scene. Following a search by officers using the National Police Air Service helicopter, a 17-year-old man from Worthing and an 18-year-old man from Horsham were arrested on suspicion of murder. They also arrested an 18-year-old woman from Crawley for assisting an offender. Police said the next of kin for the man who died have been informed, and are receiving support. Officers assured locals that they are treating the incident as isolated, and they do not believe there is a threat to the wider public. Detective Chief Inspector Debbie White said: ‘This is a fast-moving investigation and we are asking anyone with any information about the incident to please come forward. ‘We are treating this as an isolated incident with no threat to the wider community, however the public can expect to see an increased police presence in the area this evening as our enquiries continue. ‘In the meantime, we would urge the public to refrain from speculating around the circumstances. ‘Our thoughts remain with the victim’s family at this difficult time, and we are determined to find those responsible for this tragic crime and bring them to justice.” Got a story?
