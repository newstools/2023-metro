Staff at a Tesco in Wales were saddled with more jobs than usual this week – after a horse wandered into the supermarket. Bemused shoppers quickly reached for their phones as the animal wandered between the aisles. Footage showed the creature looking intently at baby food and clothes on sale. In the clip, a member of staff can then be seen trotting along next to the horse and trying to guide it away. The surprise shopper had made its way to the Tesco, in Pengam Green, Cardiff, after it strayed from a nearby field. Volunteers from local animal charity called The Healthy Horse Project were luckily quickly on the scene. They led the horse safely from the store and back to its field, bringing its attempted shopping spree to an end. Footage of the surprise visit to the store soon went viral on Facebook. One shopper commented: ‘How did it make it that far into the shop, LOL. Needed some shower gel by the looks of it.” ‘Obviously heading for the cough medicines as it was feeling a little horse,’ posted another. A Tesco spokesperson said: ‘We can only guess that the pony was tempted in by our Low Everyday Prices on oats.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
