Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s potential move to Los Angeles FC could be off as the club are yet to convince the Chelsea striker to join, according to reports. Aubameyang’s future at Chelsea looks bleak after he was dropped from the club’s 25-man Champions League squad last week in order to accommodate January signings Joao Felix, Mykhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez. Los Angeles FC have held talks with Chelsea for Aubameyang and reports in France have claimed that a loan agreement is in place between the two clubs. However, MailOnline now reports that Aubameyang is yet to agree to a move to Los Angeles FC and the Major League Soccer side ‘fear’ they will be unable to persuade the striker to sign for them until July. The report claims that both Barcelona and AC Milan are keeping tabs on Aubameyang’s situation but the striker will be unable to join another European club until the season has ended. Aubameyang has struggled since joining Chelsea from Barcelona last summer, scoring just three goals in 17 appearances so far. After he was dropped from Chelsea’s Champions League squad last week, Aubameyang was not in the team for the goalless draw against Fulham on Friday. Meanwhile, Los Angeles FC’s new season is due to begin later this month as their first MLS game is against rivals LA Galaxy on February 26. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
