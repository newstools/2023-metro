Two brothers who tried to smuggle loaded guns hidden in the panel of a microwave have been jailed. Cadien Pink, 41, and Edward Pink, 46, ordered one Taurus and three Glock-type pistols with 59 rounds of ammo from Florida. The guns, with the serial numbers removed, were posted to a business in Newham, east London, but were scanned by the US’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) branch. Agents told the Metropolitan Police who arrested the Pink brothers and discovered a voice note on Cadien’s phone from a US contact, discussing the models and specifications of guns he had requested. He denied involvement and said the contact was talking about clippers he wanted for his mobile barbering business. But he was convicted along with his brother of conspiracy to possess firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life. Cadien, from Surrey, was jailed for 14 years and Edward, from Streatham, south London, received 12 years. Detective Chief Inspector Ant Jones said: ‘The Met has fantastic working relationships with partner law enforcement agencies all over the world. ‘It’s because of our work with our colleagues in HSI that we have successfully prevented a number of lethal weapons from falling into the wrong hands here, and successfully brought to justice those who conspired to import them for use on the streets of London. ‘I’ve no doubt that this partnership working means that lives will have been saved as a result. ‘Firearms are inextricably linked to gangs, drugs markets and organised crime groups and we will stop at nothing to disrupt the use and supply of firearms on the streets of London.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
