Flipping heck, it’s nearly time for Pancake Day again. If you’ve been flat out busy (geddit, flat, like a pancake…), the date might have passed you by meaning Shrove Tuesday has creped up on you and you’re totally unprepared, or you’ve not budgeted for more food shopping (there is a cost of living crisis, after all!). Does that mean you miss out on the fun? Not if we can help it. Here, we look at where you can find the cheapest ingredients from your nearby supermarkets for perfect pancakes… First, ABC Finance broke it down by the cost of the essential ingredients needed for a straightforward, traditional pancake. So we’re talking plain flour, large eggs, milk, and vegetable oil. They found that Sainsbury’s offers the cheapest price for these essentials, totalling £4.64 for all four ingredients. Tesco is 33p more expensive, coming in second. Because you need a bit more flavour on your pancake, ABC Finance then analysed the cost of four favourite toppings – caster sugar, lemon, maple syrup, and Nutella. Again, Sainsbury’s came out as the cheapest place to buy these, at £5.15 for all four. So, with that in mind, Sainsbury’s comes out as the best supermarket for cheapest pancake day shopping. For the core ingredients and four favourite toppings, the overall cost will be £9.79. ABC Finance estimate this totals about 91p per serving. Of course, your local might be offering regional discounts or you might be entitled to discounts through Clubcards or loyalty schemes.
