No, there hasn’t been a glitch in the Matrix. That’s, naturally, what everyone assumed had happened when mysterious green lights began to pulse downwards in the night sky over Hawaii. What looked like the famous green lines of code from the Keanu Reeves blockbuster was, in fact, emitted from a satellite. The blasts of laser came from Nasa’s ICESat-2, an orbiting satellite tasked with measuring elevation. To do this, it fires 10,000 laser pulses a second down onto the surface of our planet. That equates to 20 trillion photons leaving the spacecraft – around a dozen of which are reflected back again. That allows the satellite to measure the elevation of things like ice sheets and glaciers as well as forests and urban areas. In this case, it was looking into cloud cover above Maunakea in Hawaii. The satellites antics were picked up the Subaru-Asahi Star Camera located on the Subaru telescope located on Maunakea. The footage of the lasers, shared on social media, prompted people to start wondering if Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the rest may have been right after all.
