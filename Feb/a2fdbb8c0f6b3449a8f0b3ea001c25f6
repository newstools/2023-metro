A driver has admitted to causing the deaths of a ‘beautiful couple’ after he drove into a wall. Meesha Afzal, 22, and Kyle Khan, 26, died after Eidnun Liaquat, 28, crashed his Mercedes A200 on Warwick Road, Solihull, in December 2020. The married couple, who were both wearing seatbelts, were pronounced dead at the scene. Post-mortem examinations found Meesha, a carer, died from head and neck injuries, while Kyle, a courier driver, died from a head injury. Kyle’s mum Roshni Sajida Yousaf said the ‘beautiful couple’ – who married in July 2017 – were the ‘Romeo and Juliet of this century’. She said: ‘Kyle and Meesha were my life. It breaks my heart that I’ve lost two children as she (Meesha) was my daughter too.’ ‘They would be looking down at me from heaven smiling to say “do not mourn us – we’re happy together in death too”. ‘My fallen angels Kyle and Meesha were soulmates. Gone, but never will be forgotten, forever in our thoughts, prayers and hearts.’ Liaquat, of Mountofrd Street, Sparkhill, had previously denied two charges of causing death by dangerous driving. However appearing at Birmingham Crown Court, he pleaded guilty to two alternative charges which were accepted by the prosecution. Liaquat was told by the judge that he had admitted ‘very serious charges’. He has been released on bail ahead of sentencing on April 21.
