Nicholas Hoult enjoyed a date night with his partner of six years Bryana Holly while wearing what looked suspiciously like a shiny ring on his wedding finger. The Skins actor, 33, wrapped his arm around the 29-year-old model as they walked the streets seemingly on a date night. Bryana looked fabulous in a classy black dress and some elegant heels, while Nicholas, who is hotly tipped to be taking over Henry Cavill as the next Superman, didn’t wear a cape but an oversized black coat, a mustard yellow jumper, some trainers and a beanie hat. The pair were first linked in 2017, and a year later welcomed baby Joaquin into the world, but their relationship has remained pretty private since. Although tight-lipped about their romance, the Warm Bodies actor told the Evening Standard in 2019 his ‘levels of tiredness are extreme’ after becoming a first-time parent. ‘No one warns you about it! But the level of love that comes with it outweighs everything. It’s phenomenal,’ he said. ‘I’m loving it. And it evolves all the time. They change so much, every day is different. It fills you up as a human completely.’ Fast forward a year later and Nicholas was still ‘loving’ parenting life during the pandemic. ‘It’s mad. It’s a learning curve, isn’t it? There’s a lot to take in. But overall, it’s like that time again, it brings back a lot of memories of your childhood,’ the X-Men: Dark Phoenix actor said on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2020. ‘It makes you play again — which I’m really enjoying, particularly with this time now with everything shut down and not having to work. I’m kind of just playing trains all day. It’s great.’ The most recent relationship update we’ve had from the pair prior to the snaps in question came in the form of a selfie of the pair smiling and hugging, alongside which Bryana wished her man a happy birthday back in December. ‘Happy birthday to my love 🎈😊♥️,’ she wrote. Fellow model Roxy Horner, girlfriend of comedian Jack Whitehall, commented on the snap with three love hearts, while a fan joked: ‘How many chapters did I miss?’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Nicholas Hoult’s representatives for comment.
