Do you despise working from home? Have you ever wanted to live in the same room strangers cook in? Well, this short-term let could be just the thing you’re looking for. A Richmond flatshare being advertised on SpareRoom is telling potential tenants they’ll not only need to be out of the house between the hours of 9am and 5pm, but they’ll also be sleeping in the kitchen. For £280 a week, and a deposit that comes in at £500 with some bills included, you’ll be able to live there for a month at the longest. The advert reads: ‘As the kitchen is in your room, I will need access to make a coffee, get water and get some food from the fridge. ‘I won’t be cooking smelling food so don’t worry.’ Well, isn’t that a relief! The ‘luxury’ room takes the form of an open-plan kitchen with a ‘comfy’ sofa bed in Teddington, London. In addition to being out for eight hours every day, hopeful tenants would need to make way should their flatmate need ‘access to make a coffee, get water and get some food from the fridge’. The listing says a mattress can be provided and heated floors have been installed. Wow, when they said luxury, they really meant it! No pets or smokers are allowed, but the property comes with free parking, you lucky thing. The listing also states that the rental opportunity will suit someone who is kind, happy, and keen on saving water and electricity. Do you have a story to share?
