Alejandro Garnacho took aim at Barcelona and Pedri after Manchester United’s win in the Europa League on Thursday evening. The tie was nicely poised following a thrilling 2-2 draw in the first leg at Camp Nou last week and Barcelona took the lead in the return fixture at Old Trafford through Robert Lewandowski’s penalty. But United came out firing after the half-time break as Fred’s excellent finish pulled Erik ten Hag’s side level in the 47th minute. United continued to dominate the second half and another excellent strike from Antony sealed a 2-1 win for Ten Hag’s side and dumped Barca out of the competition. Garnacho, meanwhile, came on as a second-half substitute and repeatedly caused Barcelona problems. But after the full-time whistle, the 18-year-old angered Barca supporters as he copied Pedri’s celebration and uploaded the picture to Instagram with the caption: ‘The big team advanced to the next round.’ Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo described Garnacho’s Instagram post as: ‘A gesture in very poor taste for an 18-year-old boy who hasn’t been in elite football for very long.’ Speaking after the game, Ten Hag revealed that introducing Garnacho and Antony midway through the game was part of United’s attempt to disrupt Barcelona. ‘That was one of the parts of the gameplan,’ Ten Hag said. ‘We know if we can bring Antony or Garnacho, you get in the wide areas speed, running behind and dribbles. You get belief. ‘They are so brave, both of them. They don’t fear anyone, especially at the Stretford End. They are just running behind and it gives a boost to the team.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
