Danielle Fogarty is growing her family after announcing she is pregnant with her second child. The businesswoman, 31, is already mother to 19-month-old son Mason who she shares with husband and former Ex On The Beach star Ross Worswick. In an Instagram post on Sunday, Danielle revealed they are expecting another baby with a sweet black-and-white video showing the exact moment they learned she was pregnant after a positive test, and then seeing their unborn child in an ultrasound. Soundtracked to Christina Perri’s If A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes, Danielle is then seen admiring her growing baby bump before she and Ross celebrated their happy news with family, letting off a stream of confetti. ‘& then there were 4 🫶🏼🥹 #halfway,’ she captioned the post while hinting at how far along in her pregnancy she currently is. Rushing to congratulate the couple, former Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan commented: ‘Awwww congratulations.’ Ex-Love Island star Montana Brown, who is currently expecting her first child, wrote: ‘This is such amazing news.’ Georgia Kousoulou added: ‘Aww congratulations this is beautiful.’ It comes just days after Danielle, who is the eldest child of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here winner Carl Fogarty, watched her younger sister Claudia Fogarty make her debut on Love Island in South Africa. Danielle and Ross married last year after getting engaged in 2020, and welcomed son Mason in 2021. They cemented their union with two wedding ceremonies, the first being an intimate legal occasion with only two witnesses, and the second a larger affair for their loved ones. Danielle casually broke the news of their legal ceremony to fans on social media, saying: ‘Do you want to know a secret? We got legally married! So simple, only two witnesses but it was perfect. Now bring on the big day.’ Her younger sister Claudia arrived on Love Island as a bombshell and quickly made a good impression on single Casey O’Gorman, with him later choosing to couple up with her. Claudia and Danielle are used to the spotlight as their dad Carl, 57, is a former motorcycle racer who won I’m A Celebrity in 2014. Prior to meeting Ross, Danielle was famously in a relationship with reality star Jake Quickenden until their split in 2018 after three years together. Got a story?
