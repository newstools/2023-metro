A sailor survived nearly a month at sea with nothing but ketchup, seasonings and rainwater. The Colombian navy rescued a man identified as Elvis Francois who survived some 24 days adrift in the Caribbean on a sailboat. Now, Heinz is appealing for help tracking down the 47-year-old to help buy him a new boat. ‘To whoever finds this message,’ a post on Instagram read. ‘We need help tracking down an amazing man with an amazing story. ‘You may remember Elvis Francois as the brave sailor who survived on nothing but ketchup and spices while adrift at sea for 24 days. ‘Heinz wants to celebrate his safe return home and help him buy a new boat… but we can’t seem to find him. ‘So, we are setting this message adrift into the sea of the internet, because if anyone can help us find him, it is you. ‘If you or anyone you know can help us get in contact with Elvis Francois, please drop us a DM.’ The appeal comes just a month after his sailboat was spotted from the air 120 nautical miles northwest of La Guajira peninsula. He had scrawled the word ‘help’ in English on the boat’s hull, which officials said was key to his rescue. Francois was taken to the port city of Cartagena by a passing container ship. He told authorities that his ordeal began in December when currents swept the sailboat out to sea while he was making repairs off the island of St. Martin in the Netherlands Antilles, where he lives. ‘I called my friends, they tried to contact me, but I lost signal. There was nothing else to do but sit and wait,’ he recalled. Francois survived by mixing a bottle of ketchup, garlic powder and Maggi cubes.
