Police are ‘increasingly concerned’ about a young girl who has been missing for five days. Mariama has not been seen since February 9, when she was spotted on East Street in Walworth, London. Sparse details have been released about the 13-year-old, but the charity Female in Africa says she is originally from Sierra Leon. The organisation posted on social media: ‘We are seeing a lot of children going missing. ‘Our community is still not engaging – why, we don’t know. But let’s help find this girl.’ The Metropolitan Police said they are worried about the young teenager and have asked for help finding her. Several people commented on their Twitter appeal to say they ‘hope Mariama is found safe and well’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
