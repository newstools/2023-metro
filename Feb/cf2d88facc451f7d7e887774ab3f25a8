Former US president Jimmy Carter has entered home hospice care. The Carter Centre confirmed the news this evening. In a tweet, the charity wrote Mr Carter, 98, had ‘decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention’. It came after the former president had a series of short stays in hospital. The Carter Centre, which was founded by the former President, added that he has the full support of his medical team and family, which ‘asks for privacy at this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers’. Mr Carter, a Democrat, became the 39th US president when he defeated former president Gerald Ford in 1976. He served a single term and was defeated by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980. The former president previously battled melanoma in 2015. Mr Carter had told reporters he felt ‘perfectly at ease with whatever comes,’ according to Inside Edition. The cancer had spread to his brain, but he underwent radiation treatment and later announced that he was cancer-free to the Sunday school class he teaches at Maranatha Baptist Church in December 2015. At a news conference, Mr Carter later said: ‘I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
