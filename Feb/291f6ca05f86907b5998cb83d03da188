Single and utterly sick of waiting for the right person to come along? Well, this dating site could be for you. The very kindly-named Desperate.Dating is looking for people who are just that to sign up. Urging people to ‘have fun and embrace your desperation’, the site is after new members who ideally have been single for three or more years – but that’s not a hard limit. It launches on Valentine’s Day, and almost 3,000 people have already registered and are still joining at a rate of 200 a week. Businessman David Minns, who set up the site, said: ‘I hope we will appeal to people who are fed up with the usual advice from relationship experts such as “don’t text too often” and “don’t commit too soon”. ‘As far as we are concerned the more desperate you are the better.’ ‘Hopefully,’ he added, ‘we can come to their rescue.’ With graphics that say things like ‘desperate to know you’ and ‘desperate for you to text’, it’s all about putting your heart firmly on your sleeve. So far, new members from Sheffield have been single the longest, with an average of seven years, while people from Wakefield have been single for six years, and new members from Edinburgh have been flying solo for five years and ten months. Of course, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with being single, so don’t let these numbers fool you. One person’s ‘desperate’ could be another’s ‘perfectly happy, thank you very much’.
