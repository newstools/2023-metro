Masked men raided a sex toy factory in Spain to steal £15,000 worth of gold-covered goods. Their haul included 24-Karat gold vibrators as well as a variety of ‘cheaper’ items. The men also stole £23,000 in cash from a safe after they plunged the area into darkness by cutting electricity cables. Police are determined to find out if anyone has information on the men’s comings and goings on the night. The intruders are thought to have struck just after 11.30pm on Wednesday night at an industrial estate in Carmona near Seville. Local reports say seven gold and steel vibrators were taken in all, with the more expensive sex toys valued at up to £15,300 and the ones made with the cheaper material up to £2,600. The premises targeted belonged to erotic items wholesaler Dreamlove. A spokesman for the firm that was targeted told local media it would be difficult to sell the sex toys on the black market because they are ‘rare and easily identifiable products.’ The haul may seem impressive, but it pales in comparison an incident in Northamptonshire in 2019. A truck driver had been left unable to deliver his load after thieves stole £1million worth of sex toys from the back of his vehicle. The assortment of goods were destined for Rocks-Off Ltd in Northamptonshire, but was stolen from a lay-by while the driver slept.
