A Chinese man who attempted to hide his lottery win from his wife has been ordered by a court to pay her compensation. The man, known only as Zhou, won 10 million yuan two years ago, and received 8.43 million yuan (just over £1,000,000) after tax. But instead of telling his wife, known only as Lin, he just carried on with his life as if nothing had happened, the Hangzhou Daily reported. Instead he transferred 2 million yuan to his older sister, and sent 700,000 to his ex-wife to help her buy a flat. Lin eventually discovered what Zhou had done, and filed for divorce. She asked the court in Wenzhou, in eastern China’s Zhejiang province, to divide the couple’s shared property equally. She further requested two-thirds of the 2.7 million yuan Zhou had concealed from her. The court found the money Zhou transferred to his sister and ex-wife was part of the couple’s shared property, therefore the steps he took to hide it constituted embezzlement. Judges ordered him to pay Lin the two-thirds of the hidden winnings as she requested. Neither has appealed the court ruling, the newspaper reported. The Chinese government holds national lotteries to raise money for welfare and cultural programmes, but the winnings are taxed. This isn’t the first time this has happened, either – last year another man, known only as Li, bizarrely accepted his lottery winnings in a yellow mascot costume in a bid to hide it from his family. Speaking to local reporters at the time, he said: ‘I’m really happy I won, but I don’t want my family to know about this since they might become too arrogant and complacent in the future.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
