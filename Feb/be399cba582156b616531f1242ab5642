Joe Exotic is refusing further treatment after doctors warned they think his prostate cancer has spread to his bladder. The Tiger King star is currently in jail serving a 22 year sentence on 17 charges of animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder for hire to kill his wild cat rival Carole Baskin. Exotic has now revealed he’s had a lot of blood in his urine with his urology specialit urging him to get further tests to determine if his cancer has spread. However, in an open letter to TMZ, Exotic ruled out any further treatment, writing: ‘I want to stay here and just let it take its course.’ ‘The world has to know just how corrupt our justice system is … If I have to be the one to die innocent in here fighting for the truth maybe people around the world will finally speak up for the truth for once,’ he added. After splitting from his husband Dillon Passage in 2022, Exotic reunited with his ex, Seth. He insisted he isn’t fazed by dying and only wants to spend time with his fiancé, to whom he recently left everything in his will. ‘I could care less about dying, my birthday is coming up soon and all I want is to see Seth,’ he wrote. Exotic still has 20 years left of his sentence to serve and was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2021, a year into his time behind bars. He’s called on his former Tiger King co-star John Reike to set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for his funeral costs and confirmed he wants his ashes to be scattered at the same palace as his late husband Travis Maldonado, who died by suicide ages 23 in 2017.
