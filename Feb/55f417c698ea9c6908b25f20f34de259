Some 10 Wetherspoons pubs are shutting their doors this month, is your favourite on the list? The British staple pub chain announced it was selling 35 of its boozers last September. Several have since been sold, including the following which will close over the next few weeks: The company, owned by Tim Martin, made the ‘commercial decision’ to sell amid warnings it could lose up to £30 million due to upkeep and wages. All these pubs remained trading until their deals were secured, giving regulars their last chance to get a pint at their favourite spot. There are still another 35 pubs up for sale all over the country – up for a guide price range between £1.25million to £350,000. The sale of the venues is being handled by CBRE and Savills, who describe the properties as ‘a rare opportunity to acquire substantial, landmark public houses with a high standard of fit out in high profile locations’. Spoons spokesman Eddie Gershon previously said: ‘On occasion, Wetherspoon does put some of its pubs up for sale. This is a commercial decision. ‘We understand that customers and staff will be disappointed with it. The pubs will continue to operate as Wetherspoon outlets until they are sold.’ In May, Spoons boss Tim Martin announced a series of widespread changes to the business as a result of increased labour, food and energy costs. This included a series of price hikes which saw punters throughout the country pay 10p more for a pint, with Londoners facing a 20p bump. The move is the latest setback for the 43,000 workers employed by the pub giant, who received a raise of just 20p an hour this year amid a cost of living crisis which has seen wages outstripped by soaring inflation. During the pandemic, Martin told his staff to ‘get jobs at Tesco’ after refusing to pay his workers during lockdown. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
