Liverpool midfielder Thiago is a major doubt for Monday’s Merseyside derby clash against Everton after suffering a hip injury. The Reds have been decimated by injuries this season, with Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz all spending long stints on the sidelines. Thiago, 31, missed a month of the season during the early stages of the campaign but he’s recovered to make 20 appearances in all competitions this term. Midfield has been an area of high concern for Liverpool this season, with the Reds failing to match the high energy levels that they’ve shown in recent years. And their midfield’s taken another blow ahead of Monday’s game against rivals Everton after Thiago was forced to miss training today with a hip problem. The Spaniard was unable to train due to the complaint and he’s now a major doubt to face the Toffees. ‘Thiago has some problems I have to ask him what I’m allowed to say,’ said Klopp. ‘Yes but hip flexor, stuff like this. That’s it pretty much and he’s unable to train. Liverpool are not putting a timeframe on the injury but it’s an untimely blow ahead of a jam-packed period for the Reds, with a Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid to come. Virgil van Dijk resumed training earlier this week but is not close to a return to action.
