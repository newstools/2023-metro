Machine Gun Kelly’s guitarist has rubbished claims she hooked up with the punk-pop rapper. Sophie Lloyd has played alongside Kelly since 2022, when she joined his Mainstream Sellout tour, but on Saturday found herself at the centre of cheating rumours after Kelly’s fiancé Megan Fox hinted they’d broken up. Fox, 36, posted a cryptic message about dishonesty over the weekend and cleared most photos of Kelly, 32, from her Instagram. Beneath the A-lister’s post, which is no longer visible as she’s deactivated her social media page, one of her followers wrote: ‘He probably got with Sophie,’ seemingly in reference to the guitarist. Another person added: ‘They were flirting big time in the beginning when she first started playing with him.’ In fact, Fox herself even namedropped the guitarist, writing: ‘Maybe I got with Sophie.’ Lloyd’s team have since rubbished claims she was ever romantically involved with Kelly, telling Page Six: ‘Sophie Lloyd is a professional, accomplished musician who has been needlessly dragged into the media based off of meritless accusations made by social media.’ They went on: ‘Any suggestion that she has ever acted in an unprofessional manner or stepped out of her relationship are untrue. It’s disrespectful to her as a female artist and poor journalism and social commentary to be reporting anything else.’ The outlet also noted that Lloyd has been with her boyfriend Christopher Painter for more than five years. Rumours that Fox and Kelly had called it quits went into overdrive when the former posted a series of sizzling snaps of herself over the weekend, beneath which she wrote: ‘You can taste the dishonesty/ it’s all over your breath.’ Those are of course lyrics from Beyoncé’s song Pray You Catch Me, which is thought to be about her husband Jay Z’s alleged infidelity. Beneath the Transformers star’s post, one social media user wrote: ‘I think they finally broke up. pics are gone’ while another person echoed: ‘As much as two looked good together i’m glad it’s done you mental health has to come first and he wasn’t the best thing for that.’ Others added: ‘Bye MGK,’ ‘they finally broke up’ and ‘you were way too good for MGK anyways.’ Pointing out that Fox now follows 50-year-old Eminem – who took issue with comments Kelly, real name Richard Colson Baker, made about his daughter Hailie way back in 2012 – one of her followers penned: ‘Deleted all photos of mgk and started following Eminem.’ Days after Fox’s post, the pair was seen leaving a counselling office in LA together.
