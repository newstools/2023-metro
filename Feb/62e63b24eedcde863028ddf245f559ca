An eggstravagent theft has been reported in Shropshire – but police think they’ve cracked the case. Almost 200,000 Creme Eggs were stolen from a unit in Stafford Park in Telford on Sunday. Other chocolate treats were also taken – with the haul said to be worth around £40,000, all in all. West Mercia Police joked they had ‘helped save Easter’ after launching a hunt for the snacks. A statement on Monday said: ‘Shortly after the theft a vehicle, presumably purporting to be the Easter bunny, was stopped northbound on the M42. ‘A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft.’ In an update later this afternoon, officers said a man had been charged. Joby Pool, 32, of no fixed abode, is accused of criminal damage and two counts of theft. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
