We are saying goodbye to one of the most loved soft drinks after almost 50 years on the market. Lilt, owned by Coca-Cola, has been sold under the advertising slogan ‘the totally tropical taste’ since the 1970s. But the company has announced plans to scrap the drink – and many people are less than pleased. Former Love Island contestant, Georgia Townend, was one of those Lilt fans left reeling. ‘Our rational minds told us this day may come, but our hearts always held onto hope,’ she tweeted. ‘Our beloved Lilt has succumbed to gentrification of the worst kind.’ But all is not lost as Coca-Cola confirmed the soft drink will be relaunched under a new name – Fanta Pineapple and Grapefruit. Coinciding with Valentine’s Day, drom tomorrow the ne name and packaging will roll into stores. The Fanta flavour is said to have ‘the same totally tropical taste’ as Lilt. ‘Lilt fans may have spotted a gradual transition as the drink has made its way into the Fanta family over the past few months, with changes to packaging and logo,’ said Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, the Grocer reported. ‘Some have even hypothesised on social media that Lilt may be becoming part of the Fanta brand, and one went as far as producing their own news broadcast-style video.’ Got a story?
