A man died after being attacked by a chicken that had previously gone for his granddaughter, an inquest has heard. Jasper Kraus’s injuries to his left leg were so bad that blood was spurting from the injury, his lodger Corey O’Keefe said. Jasper was attacked at his home in Killahornia, Ireland, on April 28 last year. Corey said he shouted ‘come quick’, but by the time he arrived he was drifting in and out of consciousness and kept repeating ‘rooster’. He rang paramedics to come and help and called Jasper’s daughter Virginia Guinan. When she arrived she saw her father in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor with a severe puncture wound on his calf. She followed a trail of blood that went outside to the chicken coup and that’s when she ‘realised that it must have been the chicken’, the Irish Examiner reported. Virginia said a rooster that had previously attacked her daughter had blood on its claws. At the time of the attack Jasper was in remission from cancer, previously had renal failure and was on a lot of medication. Dr Annette Jennings arrived at the scene as paramedics were attempting to resuscitate Jasper, but he was pronounced dead at 3.24pm. She added his death was unusual as a wound had been inflicted on his left calf by a chicken. His body was taken to University Hospital Galway for a post-mortem examination. Dr Ramadan Shatwan said the dad’s face was covered in dried blood when he carried out the autopsy, but there were no cuts to his face. Dr Shatwan concluded Jasper had suffered a heart attack and added another factor was blood supply to the dad’s heart was ‘severely calcified’. The coroner agreed with Dr Shatwan’s findings, recording a verdict of misadventure and expressed his sympathies to Jasper’s family.
