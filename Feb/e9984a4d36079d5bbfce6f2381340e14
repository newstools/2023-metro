A bouncer hurled ‘homophobic abuse’ at a woman as she visited an east London pub to watch the Super Bowl, it has been claimed. The doorman allegedly took issue with her sexual orientation when she arrived at The Leyton Star on Sunday. In a post on neighbourhood app Next Door, a friend wrote: ‘A party of us went there to watch the Super Bowl, the door security took issue with a friend of mine because of her sexual orientation. ‘I’m not saying the pub is the issue but they are employing openly homophobic door staff.’ He then claimed he told his friend ‘you’ll never be a man, stop acting like one,’ and allegedly called her a ‘geezer bird’ and a ‘fat d**e’. The punter said the pub is usually a ‘lovely’ place to visit. He added: ‘This place used to be a lovely pub and had no issue with members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, it seems like they now do. ‘Please take that in mind.’ The Leyton Star said they are taking the alleged incident ‘very seriously’ and have already ceased their relationship with the third-party staff member. A spokesperson said: ‘We are indeed aware of the accusation. ‘Within an hour of receiving news of this from the complainant (on Monday, February 13 at approximately 1.45pm, 12 hours after the alleged incident) we contacted the third party security company ourselves to relay this complaint to them for further investigation, and with further instruction to not employ the services of the accused, indefinitely.’ They added: ‘At the same time this complaint was raised to the Head Office who are aware of this accusation. We take this very seriously.’ The Leyton Star is part of the Electric Star pub chain, which has multiple venues across east London. Pubs part of the group include The Heathcote and Star in Leytonstone, Star of Bethnal Green and The Star by Hackney Downs. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
