Workers up and down the UK are walking out this month as energy bills rise and the cost of living crisis tightens. February has already seen upwards of 500,000 people across public and private sectors taking to the picket line. In the last month, doctors, ambulance drivers, rail workers, taxi drivers, civil servants, barristers and bus drivers have all taken industrial action. Nurses announced they are set to walk out again at the beginning of next month for 48 hours. The industrial action will involve those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, cancer care and other services that were previously under an exemption. Today, who is on strike today and how will this affect you? Arrivals to the UK have been told to prepare for disruption as the second day of Border Force staff strikes continue. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) say 1,000 Border Force officials will continue strike action in Dover, Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk. Hundreds of people from across government and the military have been trained to carry out essential checks at the border. But with the strike coinciding with the half term break, people have been warned to expect delays at border check points. British Museum workers continue their strike which has coincided with the February half term break. More than 100 members of the PCS Union will strike until February 19 from the visitor services and security team. The museum cancelled its programme of half term events and warned it might also have to close galleries at short notice. Visitors need a pre-booked ticket to enter the museum while the strikes are taking place. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
