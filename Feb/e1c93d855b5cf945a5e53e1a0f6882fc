Mars Wrigley has been fined £12,000 after two M&M factory workers fell into a waist-high vat of chocolate. Colleagues were unable to pull the pair out when they became trapped in the slowly solidifying confectionary at the site in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, last June. Emergency responders were eventually able to free the pair by cutting a hole in the bottom of the tank. The workers were taken to hospital, including one by air ambulance, but there was no indication that either had suffered injuries. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Mars Wrigley in the accident on June 7, saying the workers were not authorised to work in the tanks and were not trained on the proper safety procedures for the equipment. The workers were employed by an outside contracting firm and fell into the partially filled chocolate tank while doing maintenance work. Milk chocolate is generally melted at around 45C before tempering, which is slightly above the recommended safe temperature for a bath but unlikely to cause scalding unless maintained for a long period of time. The workers were equipped with safety clothing which may have protected them from burns until the chocolate cooled around their bodies. A Mars Wrigley representative said last week that the safety of workers and outside contractors ‘is a top priority for our business’ and they welcomed the outcome of the investigation by Osha. ‘As always, we appreciate OSHA’s collaborative approach to working with us to conduct the after-action review,’ the representative said. The site is run by Mars Wrigley, which produces M&Ms and several other popular sweet treats, including Snickers and Twix.
