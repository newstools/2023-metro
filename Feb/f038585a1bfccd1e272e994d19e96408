Another unidentified object has been shot down by the US Air Force tonight. Republican senator Jack Bergman said the military had ‘decommissioned’ another ‘object’ over Lake Huron, in Michigan. He wrote on Twitter earlier this evening: ‘I have been in contact with Department of Defence regarding operations across the Great Lakes region today. ‘The military has decommissioned another “object” over Lake Huron. I appreciate the decisive action by our fighter pilots. ‘The American people deserve far more answers than we have.’ The operation marks the third day in a row that an unidentified object was shot down over North American airspace. Unconfirmed footage shared on social media shows a round object hovering in the sky, near the border with Canada. Meanwhile, Canadian investigators are hunting for the wreckage of yet another unidentified flying object that was shot down by a US jet over Yukon territory on Saturday. ‘Recovery teams are on the ground, looking to find and analyze the object,’ prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters today. ‘The security of citizens is our top priority and that’s why I made the decision to have that unidentified object shot down.’ The Canadian leader stressed that it had posed a danger to civilian aircraft. North America has been on high alert for aerial intrusions after the appearance of a white, eye-catching Chinese airship over American skies earlier this month. Got a story?
