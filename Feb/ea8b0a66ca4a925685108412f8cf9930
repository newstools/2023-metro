Transport lovers could get the chance to test out Luton Airport’s latest new shuttle service before it rolls out to passengers later this year. London Luton Airport is about to introduce a new service which will get you to the nearest station to the airport in less time. The Luton Dart service will begin in April, replacing the current eight-minute shuttle bus with a service every 10 minutes. Instead, it will take passengers between Luton Airport Parkway station and Luton Airport in just four minutes. But they’re looking for volunteers to give it a go beforehand in a series of trial dates throughout March. The website says the test runs are to ensure ‘it provides an excellent passenger experience’. You’ll just need to bring yourself and an empty suitcase for the ride. They recommend you get into the spirit of an airport passenger, and wear comfortable, warm clothes too. Volunteers will be chosen on a first come, first serve basis and you’ll need to detail availability for each date. While you won’t be paid for the trial, there is potential to win big. If you complete all the feedback forms, you’ll be entered into a prize draw to win £250 worth of vouchers – with one lucky winner being announced after the trials. Children under the age of 12 are not permitted on these trials. Those planning to bring children between the ages of 12 and 16 years must ensure each child is accompanied by an adult. Luton Dart’s full service is due to begin before Easter 2023, and you can apply to volunteer here now. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
