There’s no area of our lives untouched by the cost of living crisis, it seems. A new study has looked into the relationship between sexual happiness and the cost of living crisis. Sexual wellness brand Lovehoney found more than half of Brits have switched up their sex and masturbation habits to cope with the stress better. With 64% of those surveyed feeling more stressed and 57% sleeping worse, similar numbers are turning to masturbation to ‘unwind and relieve tension’. Many found doing this more often had a positive impact on their stress levels and ability to sleep. It makes sense sex and solo-pleasure is on the rise – it’s a free and easy way to temporarily feel good in the body, with some calling it a form of self-care. Over a third more people are choosing to date at home currently to save money, instead of going out, which also might lead to more sex. A similar effect is happening on the speed at which couples move in together, as one in 10 have considered doing this to also save on costs. With the pandemic speeding up relationship milestones in 2020, three years on we’re still seeing couples make decisions based on outside circumstances. To avoid turning on the heating, 20% of couples are choosing to have sex instead, to warm up that way – and this number increases among 18-34-year-olds. A spokesperson for Lovehoney said: ‘The study offers stark insight into the effect of the cost of living crisis on our sex and dating lives, but also a look at the benefits of masturbation and sex. ‘The fact that so many are unaware of the ways in which masturbation can improve our general wellbeing is something we are on a mission to change.’ Do you have a story to share?
