Vladimir Putin has suffered a major ‘blow below the belt’ as Viagra will no longer be shipped into Russia. Pharma giant Viatris, which makes the popular erection drug, said it was suspending supplies due to the war in Ukraine. However, the Russian government vowed to ensure its men will still get access to drugs with the same ‘active’ ingredient. Even before the Viagra ban, Russian companies making male impotence drugs with sildenafil have increased production by 11 per cent. Sales have also risen by 15%. In its quarterly report in September, Viatris said ‘the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine did not have a material impact on our business as the combined total revenues for both countries were approximately 1 percent of consolidated total revenues’. But the company admitted ‘trade controls, sanctions, supply chain and staffing challenges and other economic considerations related to the conflict have impacted our operations in these markets’. It warned this ‘may negatively impact our financial results in future periods’. Meanwhile, Russia has created its own Instagram after parent company Meta said it would relax rules on users calling for violence against Russian soldiers. In response, Moscow branded Meta an ‘extremist organisation’ and blocked access to Instagram. The photo-sharing app is so popular in Russia, with many creators using it to make a living, that influencers were literally reduced to tears at not being able to use it anymore.
