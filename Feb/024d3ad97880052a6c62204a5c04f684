The world is a smorgasbord when it comes to delicious food. Whether you’re a fan of Italy’s pizza and pasta (who isn’t?), India’s spicy curries or France’s oh-so-refined offerings – not to mention the many, many crepes we consumed this week – we all have a cuisine we love. But now, foodies of the internet have spoken, and the world’s ultimate favourite has been revealed. Who claimed the top spot, we hear you ask? With it’s bibimbap and kimchi, Korea was a worthy winner. The results come from adventure holiday travel company, The Bucket List Company, who looked at engagement across social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Reddit. The rankings were based on the number of tags for each cuisine, as well as the amount of positive interactions from users. Second place was awarded to Italy – no surprises there – with Mexico coming in at third place.  Japan came in at fourth, while Indian food rounded off the top five. A firm comfort food favourite, Chinese, also made it into the top 10. While no African countries made it into the top 10 rankings, that might change over the coming year, as trend forecasters predict that West African food is set to rise in popularity, with searches for West African dishes on Google Trends on the up in the last 12 months. The results are sure to rustle the feathers of some countries famed for their food – much like the Taste Atlas Awards last year which caused a frenzy online after they ranked the USA ahead of France and China.
