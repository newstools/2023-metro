Love Island star Ron Hall left viewers pretty amused when he voiced aloud his thought that men have, on average, 40 erections a day. The highly-anticipated movie night truly delivered, with explosions between Claudia Fogarty and Casey O’Gorman, and a fiery row between Shaq Muhammad and Tanya Manhenga. Meanwhile, Samie Elishi and Jessie Wynter were left preparing themselves for the worst – but they’ll have to answer some questions in order to win those tell-all clips. And while answering questions tonight, Ron didn’t seem to do so well. Ahead of the first clip airing, the islanders were asked: ‘How many erections does the average man get per day?’ ‘I’m sure there’s like 40,’ Ron chimed in, leaving the boys baffled. ’40?!’ Shaq repeated, with Will Young clarifying: ‘A day!’ Meanwhile the girls were going for a more logical approach, agreeing on four, while the boys decided on 20. ‘It’s not 40!’ Will insisted. The correct answer ended up being 11 – nowhere near Ron’s initial suggestion. ’40 a day….Ron you need to get to the docs,’ one viewer wrote. Another penned: ‘Ron saying ‘40’ and being so confident with that answer is sending me’. Someone else laughed: ’40 erections Ron? FORTY?’ Elsewhere tonight, viewers were again in hysterics over Martin Akinola’s reaction to Shaq and Tanya arguing, as one fan predicted he’d become ‘2023s biggest meme’. Love Island continues tomorrow night at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
