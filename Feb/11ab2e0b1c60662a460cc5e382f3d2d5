Blackpool was hit by a 1.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. The tremor, which was at a depth of two kilometres, hit the Lancashire town at 7.36pm, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said. Thankfully the damage wrought by the quake appears to have been limited to ‘cabinets shaking’ and ‘dogs being disturbed’. But the BGS said there had been reports describing ‘a noise like a train coming near’ just before it struck. The organisation said: ‘We have received online macroseismic reports from residents in Blackpool, Little Plumpton, Weeton and Westby of this event being felt. ‘Reports described, “a noise like a train coming near”, “ourselves and several neighbours heard it”, “our dogs were disturbed” and “the computer and cabinets shook”.’ Earthquakes measuring 2.5 or less on the Richter Scale are usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph. There are estimated to be millions of them around the world each year. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
