An estimated 6,900 people have been killed and a further 18,000 injured, following the eruption of the biggest conflict on European soil since World War II, a year ago. When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, thousands also lost their homes and businesses, with a shocking 5.9 million people displaced inside Ukraine as shelling forces them from their homes. Now, more than 18 million Ukrainians are in need of humanitarian assistance, and the violence shows now sign of stopping. Up to 50% of the country’s power has been affected, and vast swathes of the population have been left with limited heating or running water. The International Rescue Committee has been working in Ukraine for the past year, distributing essential items, medical services, cash and legal support to those in need. ‘Our field teams are reminded each day of the strength and resilience of Ukrainian people, both inside the country and those who have been forced to cross borders in search of safety,’ Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine Country Director of the IRC tells Metro.co.uk. Despite their families and lives being torn apart, for many Ukrainians there is no other option than to try and carry on as best they can, as they learn to balance the brutality of conflict with every day life.
