A proud Newcastle fan has fully backed the Geordies ahead of their first cup final since 1999 by getting a new tattoo to celebrate the big day. Gary Jones has had some fresh ink with the words to a Newcastle chant that has been ringing around St James’ Park for weeks. Since Newcastle were victorious over Southampton in the Carabao Cup semi-final every Toon faithful has been singing the song and ramping up hopes and dreams Mr Jones – who already has hundreds of black and white tattoos – decided to get ‘Tell me Ma, me Ma, I won’t be home for tea, We’re going to Wembley, Tell me Ma me Ma..’ etched into his skin. His brave move comes ahead of the Magpie’s first major cup final since 1999 as they take on Manchester United in the Carabao Cup Final on Sunday. The well-inked football fan already has photos of Geordie heroes Alan Shearer and Sir Bobby Robson. Mr Jones also has tattoos of the Newcastle crest while his back is completely covered in black and white legends including Peter Beardsley and Kevin Keegan – alongside a massive print of St James’ Park. He has already added the current Newcastle captain Kieron Trippier to his leg and is hoping his celebrations haven’t started too soon. Newcastle fans are set to take over central London ahead of the cup final and are expected to paint the capital black and white. Thousands of the most loyal supporters in the world have been waiting a lifetime to watch their beloved side lift a trophy, and it is the closest they have been since they faced Man Utd in the FA Cup final in 1999.
