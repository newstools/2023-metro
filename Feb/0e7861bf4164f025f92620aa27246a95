The home where four University of Idaho students were murdered in their beds is set to be torn down. Doors and windows of the off-campus house on King Road in Moscow have already been boarded up with plywood and a temporary fence has been erected around it. It will be knocked down, the university announced on Friday, more than three months after Bryan Kohberger, 28, allegedly stabbed the students to death. ‘The owner of the King Street house offered to give the house to the university, which we accepted. The house will be demolished,’ stated university president Scott Green. ‘This is a healing step and removes the physical structure where the crime that shook our community was committed.’ A masked Kohberger allegedly entered the home around 4am on November 13 with a knife. The criminology PhD student is accused of stabbed Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20, as well as her boyfriend who was visiting, Ethan Chapin, 20. Police say Kohberger went to the home at least a dozen times before allegedly attacking and that he returned to the crime scene five hours after the killings, hours before a 911 call. Kohberger is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony burglary. He waived his right to a speedy preliminary hearing and is expected to enter a plea on June 26. The demolition will help to limit efforts to ‘sensationalize’ the scene of the crime, Green said. A memorial site and ‘healing garden’ will also be created in honor of the victims and other students who have died, he added. The place for them has not been determined. ‘We will never forget Xana, Ethan, Madison and Kaylee, and I will do everything in my power to protect their dignity and respect their memory,’ Green said. ‘Together we will rebuild and continue to support each other.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
