Two more men have been charged with the murder of a woman in Liverpool. Ashley Dale, 28, was discovered with gunshot wounds in the garden of her home in Old Swan shortly after midnight on August 21 last year. Emergency services had rushed to the address on Leinster Road where they found her seriously injured. The council worker was taken to hospital, but she died a short time later from her wounds. Merseyside Police has now charged two more men with her murder. Niall Barry, of Moscow Drive, in Tuebrook, and Sean Zeisz, 27, of Longreach Road, in Huyton, have been remanded in custody. They are expected to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court tomorrow. This brings the number of people charged with the murder of Ms Dale to four. James Witham, 40, of Ashbury Road, Huyton, and Joseph Peers, 28, of Woodlands Road, Roby, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court accused of her murder earlier this month. Police believe Ms Dale, who was described as a ‘rising star’ by her loved ones, was not the intended target of the shooting. Detectives have said one or more attackers broke down her front door before firing multiple shots inside. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
