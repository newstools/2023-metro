Victims of phone theft are tracking their stolen mobiles to the exact same street – nearly 6,000 miles away in China. Using Apple’s Find My app, many say their devices appear to be located on Huafa South Road, in Shenzhen – a city that is home to phone manufacturers. It is thought they are being stripped for parts, put back into legal markets, or turned into ‘Frankenstein phones’ – devices that look authentic but don’t contain all original parts. Victim Ketan Aggarwal’s £1,000 iPhone 14 Pro was snatched from his hand in Farringdon, central London. Using GPS tracking software, he watched it travel across the world. ‘My phone was nicked from my ear and, after tracking it to China, I’ve had an insight into what happens next,’ the 36-year-old, of Ealing, west London, added. Another victim posted on Reddit: ‘I am shocked these black markets are still profitable and a company like Apple can’t do anything to stop this.’ Prof David S Wall, a cybercrime expert at Leeds university, said: ‘My thoughts are the sim cards must have been active when they were sent to China. Victims must cancel their service as soon as their phone is stolen or lost.’ Shenzen has been described as ‘Silicon Valley’s go-to hardware garage’, by Wired magazine. ‘Chips, circuit boards, ­casings, cameras – it’s all here,’ it reported.
