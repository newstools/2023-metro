A Newcastle United superfan who lives in Australia is selling his car to fund a dream trip to Wembley. Dan Gordon will fly to the UK to see his team take on Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final. The 22-year-old has been living in Australia since August and is currently working on a remote farm. Dan is a massive fan of Newcastle’s only football club, and has been avidly following ‘the Magpies’ as they’ve progressed through the Carabao Cup competition. Now that Newcastle United has reached the cup final – their first since 1999 – Dan is keen to watch them play for the trophy. The superfan had been so confident that the Magpies would reach the final that he booked his flights back to the UK before his team had even played the semi-final. Mum Jeni, who has been given the task of selling Dan’s car, said: ‘He is crackers! He had paid for his flight home before they won on Tuesday. ‘I said, “what happens if they lose” and he said, “they’ll not!” I said, “Dan, it is a big risk to take that, it’s a lot of money to lose.” But he was confident and it has paid off for him. ‘He stays up to watch all of the Newcastle matches in Australia. The farm is in the middle of nowhere so he has to drive himself 40 minutes to the nearest town to find a pub with the match and then go to work the next morning.’ Now all Dan has to do is get a ticket for the big game.
