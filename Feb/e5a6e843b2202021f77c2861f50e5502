Vladimir Putin is preparing to send 500,000 soldiers for a ‘major new offensive’, Ukraine’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov said Russia could launch a new attack to mark the anniversary of their invasion. It would also time in with Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day, which celebrates the army. Mr Reznikov said: ‘Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more.’ The Institute for the Study of War claimed an ‘imminent’ Russian offensive is ‘the most likely course of action’. However Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR), said Ukraine is preparing for its own counteroffensive and is intending to retake Crimea over the next few months. GUR representative Andrii Yusov told Ukrainian TV that they are entering a ‘very active phase of the war’. He said: ‘Both February and March will be very intensive. ‘The skill and motivation of Ukrainian soldiers, plus their equipment and weapons, both domestic and help from international partners, are what will ultimately turn the tide of these offensive actions.’ Senior Ukrainian soldiers have also urged Russians to abandon their military posts before they are killed. Lieutenant General Yurii Sodol, head of Ukraine’s marines, said: ‘Before it’s too late, run. Return to your Russian women or surrender, otherwise it’s the fate of a fertiliser on someone else’s land; a black bag or disability awaits you – this is your “happy” future. ‘Unlike you we know what we are fighting for, we are united, we are one. ‘We will do everything so that the blue-yellow flag flies again in all cities of Donbas and Crimea.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
