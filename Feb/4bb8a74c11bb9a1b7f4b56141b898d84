Ant and Dec have admitted they had concerns about the new series of Britain’s Got Talent – the first since David Walliams’ exit. David quit Britain’s Got Talent and was replaced by former Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli after the Little Britain star came under fire over leaked recordings which exposed his scathing remarks about contestants. He later apologised for the comments before it was confirmed he would not be returning to Britain’s Got Talent in 2023 alongside Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon. Ant McPartlin, however, has insisted he and Declan Donnelly ‘love’ David still and they’ve remained good pals. ‘We text a lot, we see him socially, so we were really kind of apprehensive about starting this new series,’ he told Huff Post UK. ‘But on the first day of auditions, we thought, “we’ve got to just treat Bruno like the new guy and be kind to him”. And he was really nervous. ‘We spoke to him just before, and he said, “I can’t tell you just how nervous I am”, which surprised us because he’d done Strictly, he’s on Dancing With The Stars in America still… he’s no stranger to big TV shows. ‘So I felt sorry for him, but I thought it showed real humility. And we were just kind to him. We laughed at him when he made mistakes, but tried to show him the ropes a bit.’ It’s already been revealed Bruno ‘broke the rules’ by pushing his golden buzzer twice and has been having all his co-judges in stitches. Nothing tops Simon though, who was ‘set on fire’ during one audition. Britain’s Got Talent returns to ITV later this year. Got a story?
