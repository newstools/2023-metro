A popular holiday destination for Brits, Mallorca is known for its roasting temperatures and sunny beaches. But yesterday Spanish authorities issued a red alert, with the areas of Valldemossa and Lluc covered in a blanket of snow. Temperatures have dropped to -2°C after Storm Juliette hit the Balearic island over the weekend. Spain’s meteorological agency, AEMET, warned a further 16 inches (40cm) of snow is expected to fall over the next 24 hours. Maritime storms with huge waves and heavy gusts are expected, triggering the rare red weather alert on the north of the island. An amber alert for rainfall and one for wind have also been issued, with wind speeds expected to reach up to 80kph in several areas. The authorities have urged people not to travel unless absolutely necessary. ‘We all knew it [bad weather] was coming,’ senior emergency official Damir Trut told regional N1 television. ‘I am really surprised people didn’t listen.’ Heavy snow has left several roads closed in more mountainous regions. A cold weather alert was triggered in 30 provinces of Spain due to the storm, which is the tenth of the season. The province of Lleida, in the Catalonia region, recorded a temperature of -18.6°C early on Monday morning. The freezing weather is expected to continue until Thursday. But the UK could be next to be hit, with snow a possibility as soon as this Friday. The Met Office says long-range forecasts suggest there is a ‘small possibility’ of snow in the south of England as the country battles a ‘wintry blast’ through March. And some maps from other forecasters show snow blanketing much of the UK in what will be a ‘very cold and snowy’ March. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
