An east London shop has been told to pay £26,899 in fines and costs after a repeat rodent infestation. Environmental Health Officers from Waltham Forest Council visited Sambros International, trading as Aryubi Express, in Leyton, in December 2019. Inspectors found food spillages, rat droppings and gnawed food packaging around the store. Company director Mr Ehsan Sherzad had already received a written warning following an inspection in May 2019, resulting in the store being given a food hygiene rating of one out of five. The 29-year-old proprietor subsequently failed to attend multiple hearings, which were also subject to Covid delays. The case was eventually heard in his absence on January 31, 2023. His company – ISA (UK) Enterprises Limited – was ordered to pay a £25,000 fine as well as cover £1,709 in costs and a victim surcharge of £190. Council officers told the court that ‘an ongoing rat infestation was found on the premises, including food on display for sale that had been eaten by rats.’ Cllr Khevyn Limbajee, Cabinet Member for Community Safety at Waltham Forest Council, said: ‘The sizeable financial penalty in this case should go some way towards illustrating the extent of the offences and the failure of Mr Sherzad to heed repeated warnings. ‘While Waltham Forest Council always works with food service operators to improve their hygiene ratings, we will come down as hard as possible on those who so brazenly disregard their public health obligations.’ Waltham Forest Council has confirmed the shop has since shut down, after it was listed as permanently closed on Google and its number is disconnected.
