An airplane was left severely damaged after struggling to land in windy conditions at Stansted Airport. The Challenger 604 aircraft, which has room for up to 12 passengers, had approached the runway as it arrived on January 31, 2022. But strong winds made it difficult to do and led to a hair-raising landing. The plane had hovered above the runway for several seconds instead of touching down. It then suffered a runway excursion – a term used to describe a safety incident – with its left wing tip hitting the grass on one side. No passengers or aircraft staff were injured, but the aircraft was badly damaged. A full Government investigation is now underway to determine more about the landing. The Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB), a branch of the Government, said experts would analyse ‘an accident involving Challenger 604 aircraft, N999PX, which had a loss of control and runway excursion during an attempted landing at London Stansted Airport.’ In an update, the AAIB said: ‘After flying an ILS approach to Runway 23, with a strong crosswind, the aircraft was flared after which it floated above the runway at about 10 ft agl for several seconds. ‘The aircraft then diverged off the runway and rolled left, as a result of which the left wing tip made contact with the grass. ‘The stick pusher activated at some point causing the aircraft to bounce onto its nosewheel. ‘A go-around was executed after which the crew elected to divert to London Gatwick Airport. ‘There were no injuries, but the aircraft was severely damaged.’ The Challenger 604 can complete eight-hour non-stop flights, making it suitable for non-stop transatlantic charters as well as short- and medium-haul trips. A final report into the accident is expected to be published later this year. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
