A serving Metropolitan Police Service officer has been charged with rape and assault. PC Jorden Brown, attached to London’s Central East Command Unit, was charged on Friday 6 January with rape and three counts of actual bodily harm. He is set to appear before Barkingside Magistrates Court tomorrow. The alleged offences are said to have taken place between November 2018 and February 2019 and relate to one victim, Scotland Yard said. The offences were reported to the police in October 2019 and an investigation was launched. The officer has been suspended from duty, the force added. Detective Superintendent Dan Rutland, from Central East Command Unit, said: ‘PC Brown has been suspended and criminal proceedings will now follow. ‘While I recognise the inevitable strength of public feeling, is important that nothing is said that will put those proceedings at risk.’ Brown was charged by postal requisition, otherwise known as a court summons letter.
