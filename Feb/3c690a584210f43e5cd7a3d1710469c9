Pete Doherty recalled thinking he’s been kidnapped by two Russian artists as he made a triumphant return to TV on The Last Leg. The Libertines frontman, 43, made a rare TV appearance on the comedy series presented by Adam Hills and Josh Widdecombe, who was quite rightly fan-girling over the indie-pop icon all night. It’s no secret the former wild rebel of the noughties has lived a pretty eventful life, detailed in his absolutely wild memoir, but he stunned everyone when he recalled a particularly stressful ordeal when he thought he was being held hostage when two Russian artists locked him in a flat in Moscow. ‘When they were in London I put them up so they were supposed to put me up,’ he began. ‘They locked me in their flat and that was part of their installation but they didn’t tell me. It was terrifying. ‘It was in this big brutalist style flat and there were no windows. I couldn’t get out. They filmed it all and transmitted it to the gallery. ‘That was their installation, me freaking out in the flat. It got really good reviews though.’ Later in the show, Pete also performed a cover of Ewan MacColl’s Dirty Old Town in a tribute to Ukraine. Naturally, with Pete’s TV appearances being few and far between, fans were thrilled to see him again. ‘I was completely surprised at how brilliant a guest Pete Doherty was on The Last Leg? Genuinely wonderful stuff from him, all through it,’ said one viewer, while another agreed: ‘He has a good heart and a beautiful spirit.’ A third implored everyone to watch the episode, tweeting: ‘Pete Doherty on The Last Leg. If you have the means to watch it, you absolutely must. It gives me much joy to see him thriving.’ The Last Leg is available to stream on All4. Got a story?
