A trade union boss has issued a dire warning that train strikes could last until 2026 as the stalemate with the government continues. The news comes as the country grinds to a halt yet again today with operators like Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Southern not running any trains. Train drivers have walked out in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions with Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan saying they’ve not had a pay increase in four years. He warned workers will only stop striking once a suitable pay settlement has been reached with the government. Speaking from a picket line at London Euston station, he said: ‘What option do we have? ‘If you haven’t had a pay rise for four years, do you wait five? Do you wait six or seven?’ He said negotiations with the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) have gone backwards rather than forwards. RDG chairman Steve Montgomery admitted talks ‘have not moved on as quickly as we’d like’. ‘We all understand that we want to give our staff a pay increase, (it’s) naturally important, particularly in these economic climates,’ he told Sky News. ‘But drivers’ average wages are £60,000 at this moment. We are offering up to £65,000 over two years. That’s quite a significant increase for people.’ He went on to say he feels closer to closing a deal with the RMT union whose members have also been striking in recent months. ‘RMT are presently consulting their members (on an offer) at this moment in time,’ he went on to say. ‘What we are seeking from RMT is to put that offer out to a referendum to the members and let them decide whether this offer is acceptable as a best and final (one). ‘I’m hopeful that the offer we’ve made will stop the strikes.’ Train drivers also took part in a day of industrial action on Wednesday which involved other public sector workers.
