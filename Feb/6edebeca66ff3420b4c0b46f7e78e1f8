Kylie Minogue’s ex has shared a cryptic post after splitting from the Australian pop star. The singer, 54, started dating GQ exec Paul Solomons after meeting through mutual friends in 2018. However, it was recently reported that they had parted ways, with long distance believed to have taken its toll, since Kylie has been Down Under and Paul in London. A source claimed they ‘tried to make it work’, but ‘the time difference was a killer.’ The insider added to The Sun: ‘Kylie initially wanted to keep the split quiet though as she really does not want the narrative to be “poor, unlucky-in-love-Kylie’s heartbreak’s again”. ‘She’s a powerful, hugely successful woman – and isn’t moping around, heartbroken.’ It’s believed that Kylie and Paul have remained friends, but the I Should Be So Lucky singer is channelling her heartbreak into her work, with a tour around the corner. And it appears Paul is also ready to enter back into public life, taking to social media to share an image that provoked a lot of chatter. Taking to Instagram, the magazine mogul uploaded an image of a single red love heart on a white background. The post didn’t have a caption, but Paul’s 19.7k followers did all the talking. Many believed it to be a reference to his recent heartbreak, wishing both him and the Loco-Motion songstress well. ‘Hope you are ok paul ❤️❤️’, one follower commented. Another wrote: ‘😢I’m gutted x’ ‘Kylie !!!!! ❤️❤️’, exclaimed one. The woman herself actually liked the Instagram post, although it was later clarified what Paul meant, showing how she was being supportive of his new endeavours despite their separation. In a second post, Paul uploaded a video promoting his latest project, after working on the What Love Is music video with singer Zak Abel. So, just as Kylie is thought to be giving her all to her work following her break-up, Paul seems to be doing the same. Kylie and the creative director also still follow one another on Instagram and while Kylie’s page doesn’t boast any pics of her now-ex, she features several times on his still. While the music icon has kept much of their relationship on the down-low, she spoke last February about how they kept things going while spending so much time apart. Kylie said she was ‘used to’ the long distance, which is ultimately rumoured to have been their downfall. She said at the time that she and Paul were ‘in a very good space’ that they were ‘cherishing.’ ‘We use the term “fluid and pivoting”.’ Got a story?
