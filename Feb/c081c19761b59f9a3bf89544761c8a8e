The bodies of a man and a dog in the Scottish Highlands have been confirmed as missing Yorkshire hillwalker Kyle Sambrook and his Beagle named Bane. The 33-year-old travelled from West Yorkshire to Glencoe with his dog on February 18. He had told loved ones he planned to walk and wild camp on Buachaille Etive Mor, one of the country’s most recognisable Munros. Kyle was planning to return to his home three days later, but had not been heard from since the day he started his hike. A body was found in the Glencoe are at around 2.15pm yesterday, following extensive searches by mountain rescue teams and the coastguard. A police spokesperson said: ‘Kyle’s family wish to thank all involved in the search and have requested their privacy be respected. ‘There do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.’ Glencoe Mountain Rescue was heavily involved in the search operation, confronting thick snow and steep cliffs over the course of several days.
