Don’t know what to get your mum as a present for Mother’s Day this year? Yes, it’s that time of year again already. If you’re planning a trip to the makeup section of your local shop, or fancy ordering her an air-fryer from Amazon, then you might want to think twice. Research conducted by Red Letter Days reveals that ‘traditional gifts’ aren’t topping lists for Mother’s Day any more – as almost half of mothers just want to spend more time with their families. One in ten mums and mother figures are ‘tired’ of getting the usual makeup and skincare products. Not only that, but almost half have either thrown away, regifted or just not used their Mother’s Day presents from years gone by. Around 1,500 mums were polled, and 45% said that they would prefer ditching presents in favour of some quality time with their close ones. However, this may be easier said than done, with one in 10 parents seeing their grown-up kids just once a year because they live too far away. Following these findings, Red Letter Days has launched a new offering on its website – the option to apply for flights home to see mum. Launching on 15th February, Brits from all over the world can register their interest in giving their mums a surprise reunion. ‘When Mother’s Day rolls around we routinely gift mums the same things without really thinking about what they actually want – as our research proves,’ said Christine Ducker, senior PR and communications manager at the company. ‘But sometimes the best presents are the simplest, and we need to prioritise time with our mums over sending token flowers.’ Do you have a story to share?
