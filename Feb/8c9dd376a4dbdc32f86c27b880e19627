A murder investigation has been launched after a man was found dead in a car park in Essex. Police believe he had been previously been assaulted at a nearby pub. The man, in his 40s, was discovered in a car park next to an Iceland on Furtherwick Road in Canvey Island. Emergency services rushed to the scene just before 1.45am but, despite the best efforts of paramedics, he died at the scene. It is believed the man had been attacked near to the town’s Haystack pub a short while earlier. Detective chief inspector Greg Wood, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘I want to extend my condolences to the family of the man who has died. ‘There is a team of officers and staff working hard to establish what happened to him and we are starting to build a picture of the circumstances around the assault. ‘If you saw what happened, or have any other information about the assault then I need you to contact us.’ An area of the island including Furtherwick Road and Long Road has been cordoned off while the police investigate. Disruption is expected to the centre of Canvey throughout the day. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
