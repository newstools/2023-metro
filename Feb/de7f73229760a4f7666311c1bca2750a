Does this sheet of ice bear a striking resemblance to the outline of an English island? Without giving away the answer, it is known for its beaches, white chalk rocks, and a 19th-century lighthouse. If you guessed the Isle of Wight, we salute you. Not naming any names, but some people in the office could not. The Isle of Wight-shaped ice sheet was discovered by Mylee Rooke while out on a walk on the island with her family at Porchfield, a village near Calbourne. The nine-year-old was was heading towards the beach when she stopped to pluck the ice sheet out of a puddle. This is when she realised it was the same shape as the island where she has grown up. Her mum, Jennie, said: ‘Mylee found it in on a track down through a farm to the sea – it is one of our favourite walks. ‘She just pulled it from the puddle, we obviously could not see it was that shape until she held it up and I commented that it looked like the Isle of Wight. ‘Quite remarkable as it really does bear a striking resemblance to the Island – she was so pleased. ‘She took great pleasure in smashing it on the ground after the photo.’ Jennie took to Facebook to post the playful picture of her daughter with the piece of ice. The post racked up a massive 1,400 reactions, with many people commenting on the likeness. One local noted that the find was ‘cool in every sense of the word’, whilst others posted similar, but smaller, finds of island shaped ice sheets. Jennie added: ‘I’m shocked at the response – it’s had thousands of likes. It’s always nice to see some lighthearted news.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
