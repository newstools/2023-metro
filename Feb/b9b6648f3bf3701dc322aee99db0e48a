The family of a 74-year-old killed in a park has paid tribute to a ‘beautiful, loving lady who had an infectious zest for life’. Lorna England is thought to have been stabbed to death in Exeter on the afternoon of February 18. People at Ludwell Valley Park ran to her aid, but were unable to save the ‘beloved wife, mum, grandma and sister’. Cameron Davis, 30, from Exmouth, has been charged with murder. In a tribute issued through Devon and Cornwall Police today, Lorna’s loved ones said she was ‘tragically and suddenly taken from us’. They said: ‘Lorna was the kindest, most generous and beautiful loving lady. ‘Her energy and zest for life was infectious. As a family, we are heartbroken by her death. ‘No words can describe the loss and impact. She meant the world to us. ‘We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for all the support, kind words and sympathy we have received.’ The family has asked for privacy as they grieve and come to terms with Lorna’s death. Davis remains in custody and a trial date has been set for August 14 at Exeter Crown Court. Devon and Cornwall Police have created a Major Incident Public Reporting (MIPP) page as part of an investigation. The MIPP allows members of the public who may have information to directly send large files such as Doorbell, CCTV and Dashcam footage that could assist in a police investigation.
