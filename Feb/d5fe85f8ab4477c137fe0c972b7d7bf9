Arsenal’s match-winner Gabriel Martinelli has revealed what manager Mikel Arteta told the players at half-time after the Gunners’ 1-0 win at Leicester. The north London club went into the break at 0-0 but Martinelli scored moments after the restart to secure Arsenal a vital victory in the Premier League title race. Manchester City beat AFC Bournemouth later in the day, meaning Arsenal remain two points clear of Pep Guardiola’s second-placed team with a game in hand. Quizzed about what boss Arteta told his squad in the dressing room after the opening 45 minutes against Leicester, Martinelli said: ‘The manager said we had to win in any context, and in this league you have to win matches in this way.’ Martinelli appeared to twist his knee during his goal and there were fears that the Brazil international was going to hobble off injured before he carried on. The 21-year-old has played down any injury fears as he told Arsenal’s website: ‘Nothing happened, I’m fine!’ Speaking more generally about Saturday’s win at the King Power Stadium, Martinelli added: ‘Yeah, it was a tough, tough game, but we did it, three points is the most important thing. ‘I think in most of the games in the league we are doing this (controlling games). I think we need to keep going and be patient when we get in the final third. ‘We did it today, we got the goal and the win as well. It was a good goal, a beautiful goal, it was a great ball from Leo (Leandro Trossard) and I just put it in the back of the net, it was a good goal. ‘[The clean sheet is] very, very important. The gaffer was saying to us this week that we needed a clean sheet and we did it today, I’m so happy for that. ‘We go again [against Everton on Wednesday], another game against them, at home and we’ll go for it.’ MORE : Brendan Rodgers says Arsenal 'will go very close' to winning the title on one condition MORE : Mikel Arteta rates Leandro Trossard performance in new position against Leicester City
