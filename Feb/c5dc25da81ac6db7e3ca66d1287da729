Self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate will be held in detention in Romania for a further 30 days. Police in the eastern European country are continuing to investigate claims of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group levelled against Tate and his brother Tristan. The two men have maintained their innocence on all the charges. A pair of women who were detained at the same time, former police officer Luana Radu and model Georgiana Naghel, will now be held under house arrest. Tate, a former kickboxer, was taken into custody on December 29 last year alongside his brother. This is the third time their detention has been extended: they were initially detained for 24 hours, which became 30 days. Another 30 days were added last month. Earlier this month, Tate, 36, said as he left court: ‘Ask them for evidence and they will give you none, because it doesn’t exist.’ Prosecutors say the pair recruited their alleged victims by seducing them, and then forced them to produce pornographic content under duress. The two women are alleged to have been their accomplices by helping to ‘coerce’ and ‘control’ at least six women. According to Romanian news site Gandul, the men’s lawyer Eugen Vidineac said they would ‘challenge’ a decision for them to remain in detention. Tate’s arrest came just 24 hours after he got into a high-profile spat with environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg on Twitter. Speaking about the matter for the first time yesterday, Greta told ABC News: ‘There are many, many problems in the world that we need people dealing with. ‘But it seems like they feel so threatened or they feel like their worldview is so threatened by people like me – climate activists and environmental activists – speaking up that they feel like they need to silence us and mock us.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
