A climber has died after falling ‘a considerable distance’ from a mountain ridge in Snowdonia. The man was climbing the 3,200ft Y Gribin with two others on Saturday when a handhold broke, the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation (Ovmro) said. Mountain rescue teams then rushed to the scene, between the Glyder Fawr and Glyder Fach peaks. They rescued two men on ‘steep, loose ground’ however, due to poor conditions, could not recover the body of the man who fell until the following morning. An Ovmro spokesman said: ‘Three young men were ascending the Gribin ridge when a handhold broke away, causing one to fall a considerable distance. ‘Sadly, he did not survive his injuries. ‘The recovery continued through to Sunday lunchtime with the help of the coastguard rescue helicopter. ‘The thoughts of all team members are with the casualty’s family and friends.’ The man, from Yorkshire, has not been named but is believed to be in his twenties.
