A giraffe has died after he broke his neck inside his enclosure at a zoo in New York. Parker, a popular six-year-old Masai giraffe, was found dead at Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester, US. Vets rushed to help the animal which was found stuck in a gate inside Animals of the Savanna Building but it was too late, The Sun reports. Superintendent Steve Lacy explained the gate had been installed in 2018 and it was a ‘standard giraffe enclosure feature’. He said: ‘The possibility of this kind of event happening was unforeseen and unprecedented.’ Parker had been housed at the zoo since 2018, and was in ‘excellent health’. He fathered giraffe Olmstead, who was born last April. Seneca Park Zoo veterinarian Chris McKinney said: ‘Parker will be sorely missed by all. ‘He had been in excellent health prior to this and was a joy to both staff and visitors.’ An autopsy confirmed Parker died from a broken neck, and he died instantly. The zoo confirmed the structure is now being modified to prevent any further accidents. Dan Ashe, president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said: ‘Our hearts go out to the Seneca Park community and all the dedicated professionals at Seneca Park Zoo with the news of the death of their giraffe Parker.’ Monroe county executive Adam Bello said: ‘This is a tragedy for the Seneca Park Zoo community. ‘From the staff who cared for and loved Parker, to the zoo guests and members who had their visits brightened by Parker’s presence, we are all grieving this tremendous loss.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
