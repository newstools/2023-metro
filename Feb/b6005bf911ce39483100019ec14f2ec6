Aston Martin have announced who will replace Lance Stroll for the Formula One season opener if he fails to recover from injury in time. Stroll was injured in a bicycle accident last week which forced him to miss pre-season testing but it was hoped that he would be fit enough for the first race of 2023 in Bahrain. However, rumour has it that the Canadian’s injury is worse than previously thought and as a result he may be forced to miss the race. If that was the case, Aston Martin would have to find a replacement, with some reports emerging that four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel could be drafted in just a few months after he retired. But on Sunday the team confirmed that reserve driver Felipe Drugovich would be the man called upon if Stroll is unable to race, though they remained coy on the fitness of their main driver. In an update issued via social media, Aston Martin said: ‘The team will continue to give Lance every chance to race, pending recovery from his injury. ‘Should he not be fit to compete, then Felipe will drive the AMR23 alongside Fernando [Alonso].’ 22-year-old Drugovich joined Aston Martin last year shortly after winning the Formula 2 title and stood in for Stroll during pre-season testing last week, impressing team principal Mike Krack. Should he be called upon, the Bahrain Grand Prix will mark the Brazilian’s F1 debut and he’ll be the first driver from his country to race since Pietro Fittipaldi for Haas at the end of 2020. Aston Martin finished seventh in the standings last season but looked very quick in testing and some have even tipped Alonso to be in contention to win in Bahrain next Sunday.
