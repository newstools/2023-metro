Dan Walker has given fans an update following his nasty accident which left him bruised and bloody. The former Strictly Come Dancing star shared a tweet on Monday, saying he was ‘glad to be alive’ after being knocked over by a car. ‘Bit of an accident this morning. Glad to be alive after getting hit by a car on my bike,’ the 45-year-old wrote after snapping some selfies in the ambulance. ‘Face is a mess but I don’t think anything is broken. Thanks to Shaun and Jamie for sorting me out and the lovely copper at the scene. ‘This is my smiling 😂 Thankful for our NHS ❤️.’ Now, the Channel 5 presenter has said he’s ‘blown away by all the lovely messages’ he’s received after, miraculously, managing to not break any bones. ‘Battered and bruised but – amazingly – nothing broken. Very thankful to still be here,’ he wrote alongside a selfie from back at his home, with a black eye, scraped hands, bloody nose and ruined white shirt. But, Dan still managed to flash a thumbs up! ‘I have no memory of anything and just remember coming round on the tarmac with paramedics & police around me’, he wrote. ‘Thanks for all your kindness. Jamie & Shaun were so great in the ambulance – not sure I was making much sense’, he added with a selfie from the hospital. ‘Thanks to Conor the copper, Charlotte in x-ray & Hannah (below) for being so considerate & brilliant in such a busy A & E’. Dan then stated that the helmet he was wearing ‘saved my life’, urging fellow cyclists to also ‘get one on your head’. ‘Smashed my watch & phone, ruined my trousers, my bike is a mess but I’m still here’, he assured. ‘Currently eating soup through a straw and being looked after by this gorgeous, tired nurse’, he signed off, alongside a picture of his adorable dog. Dan’s followers were quick to wish him well in the replies, with one joking: ‘You made the News yourself today Danny !’ ‘Glad to hear you’re doing well! Rest up and speedy recovery x’, added another. Following Dan’s accident, the broadcaster was replaced on Channel 5 News while he recuperates. Tessa Chapman will instead take his place on the programme, who’s a chief correspondent and occasional presenter on the show. Got a story?
