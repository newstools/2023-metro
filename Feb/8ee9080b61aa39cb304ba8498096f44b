Marcus Rashford has been passed fit to start for Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final clash against Newcastle United. The England forward was an injury doubt for today’s game at Wembley after he came off in United’s 2-1 win against Barcelona on Thursday. Rashford removed his left boot after he was substituted and he appeared in a fair amount of discomfort as Erik ten Hag’s side came from behind to beat the Catalans. That was the only sour point of an otherwise fantastic night for United and Ten Hag admitted on Friday that Rashford could miss the Wembley showpiece. However, Rashford passed a late fitness test this morning and lines up in a front three alongside Wout Weghorst and Antony. Antony was the matchwinner against Barcelona, emerging from the bench to score a fine effort. Jadon Sancho drops to the bench, while Diogo Dalot comes in for Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the only changes from Thursday’s starting line-up.
