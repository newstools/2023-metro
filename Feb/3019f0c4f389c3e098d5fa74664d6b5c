A huge stash of terrifying weapons has been discovered at a house in Devon. Among them was a Wolverine-style, triple-bladed knuckle duster, machetes, knives, swords, axes and shurikens. They were found at a house in Tavistock but while it is not believed that they were being kept with the intention of causing harm, it is illegal to own such items. It is an offence to buy, possess or lend various knives and weapons, so they were all confiscated. Police said after the discovery: ‘It’s important to note that we do not believe these items were held with any immediate intent to cause harm but a top job from the team removing them from the public domain.’ Last year, consumer group Which? found banned items such as zombie knives, knuckle dusters, swords and batons were being sold on AliExpress, Amazon, eBay and Wish. Third-party sellers use creative ways to avoid detection and list the weapons on online marketplaces for as little as 49p. Some of the listings use special characters, such as ‘baton’, in the title, or the word only being used in the artwork – presumably to avoid detection by moderators. Simple searches of the terms ‘flick knife’, ‘automatic opening knife’ and ‘spring assisted knives’ returned dozens of results on each. Many were priced at less than £10 and some were even marketed for self-defence. Someone found with any of these weapons, even inadvertently, could face a prison sentence.
