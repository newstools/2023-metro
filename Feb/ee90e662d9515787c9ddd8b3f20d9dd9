Getting bored of your watery latte and dry croissant? Well, thanks to one of London’s most iconic hotels, you can add a touch of elegance to your mornings. Claridge’s have recently opened ArtSpace Café, a newly launched eatery on the bottom floor of the hotel, which offers a more sophisticated breakfast and lunch menu than your average coffee shop. As you dash to your desk, you could pick up a Gruyére omlette, a Claridge’s Croque Madame, or perhaps a coconut chai pudding. And with Pancake Day upon us, there’s a range of galettes and crepes, including a seafood cocktail offering, which features lobster, white crab meat, and caviar. Ooh la la. Of course, you can still get your caffeine fix with a range of artisan coffees from Cornish company Origin Coffee Roasters. Or if you’ve got a sweet tooth, there’s Claridge’s signature hot chocolate, a luxurious drink made by melting solid chocolate in hot milk. Yes please. And with the entire menu designed to takeaway, there’s even more fun to be had. You can also grab and go with a cheeky glass of champers or wine. The range of pastries on offer come courtesy of Claridge’s executive pastry chef, Thibault Hauchard. French classics include a caramel Saint Honoré (basically a lot of pastry caramel goodnes), as well as the Claridge’s Crest Cake – a chocolate replica of the hotel’s coat of arms. You can find ArtSpace – where you can also access a gallery which rotates free exhibition – via it’s own entrance on Brook’s Mews, Mayfair. Do you have a story to share?
