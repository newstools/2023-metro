Campaigners are aiming to sign hundreds more UK companies up for four-day working weeks after a test run led to triumph. Out of 61 companies that entered a six-month trial, 56 have extended the four-day-week policy that sees workers’ pay remain the same. Eighteen of these companies have already made the shorter hours permanent. Now, a new National Rollout Programme is being launched by the 4 Day Week Campaign alongside think tank Autonomy. Companies that take part will be given help with the transition starting from mid-April. The campaign calls for a 32-hour working week with no change in pay to become the normal way of working by the end of this decade. But the British government hasn’t appeared interested so far though – with business minister Martin Callanan saying in September that ministers had not looked into the costs and benefits. Meanwhile, Conservative peer Howard Leigh claims it would have a ‘devastating effect’ as it would be hard for staff to ‘work effectively’ together if some are not available. Activists argued today that positive results had been demonstrated for workers’ well-being and productivity. Joe Ryle, Director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, said: ‘The huge response we’ve seen to the pilot results just shows that the world is ready for a four-day working week. ‘We’ve had 100 years of the 9-5, five-day working week and it’s time for change. ‘Moving to a four-day week would give us all the time to be able to live happier and more fulfilled lives.’ Meanwhile, Will Stronge, Co-Founder of Autonomy, says ‘the evidence is clear’ and the policy has ‘benefits to both workers and businesses’. The trial last year was the world’s biggest and grabbed attention across the globe in places including Bangkok, India and Australia. US Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted about it, saying ‘it’s time to move toward a four-day work week’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
