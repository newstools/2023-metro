John Travolta went all out for his 69th birthday in Las Vegas last weekend. The Grease heartthrob took his 22-year-old daughter Ella Bleu Travolta dancing in Sin City to mark his big day. Along with some pals, the actor boarded a private plane that overflowed with delicious food and bubbly, and set off on a weekend to remember. The star posted a collection of videos from the weekend and tied them together with Elvis Presley’s legendary tune Viva Las Vegas, which the late King Of Rock ‘n’ Roll wrote for the 1964 film of the same name. John attempted to capture the atmosphere of a 1960s trip to Sin City as he began the compilation with an iconic TWA airlines poster from the time, which he made an addition to as he wrote at the bottom: ‘Fly Travolta World Airlines’. What ensued was what looked like a raucous weekend of fun, and John seemed to enjoy himself too as he captioned the memories with: ‘I wanted to make my favorite childhood airline poster come to life for my birthday! So here we go! Viva Las Vegas! ✈️🍸🎰’. John and his friends went all out and donned penguin suits for the plane journey, which looked to be just as fun as Vegas itself, as they feasted on what looked like roast beef, wine and an array of cocktails. Once the plane touched down in Sin City, the drinks continued flowing as the gang enjoyed a live performance, before trying their luck with some dice. The fun continued with more incredible performances before the doting father twirled his daughter around in a sweet moment when the pair danced together in a hotel corridor. The weekend didn’t slip by without John blowing out some candles on his birthday cake, which had a silky chocolate ganache finish. At the crescendo of the upbeat Elvis song, the group was seen flying back off into the sunset after what looked like an incredible weekend. John shared his daughter with his wife, the late actor Kelly Preston, before she died in 2020 at age 57 from breast cancer. Kelly was also survived by her and John’s third child, 12-year-old Benjamin. The pair’s firstborn son, Jett, tragically died in 2009 following a battle with Kawasaki’s disease, aged 16. Luckily, John and Ella seem very close, as they also teamed up for New Year’s to send a sweet message to the actor’s followers. Ella seems to be following in her father’s footsteps as a budding actor, as she starred alongside her parents in 2009’s Old Dogs, before again appearing with her father ten years later in 2019’s The Poison Rose. This also comes after John’s Grease co-star Dame Olivia Newton-John died aged 73 last year. On hearing the news John was apparently ‘too heartbroken and raw to speak’. It’s safe to say the actor deserves a bit of fun after his last few years, and we couldn’t be happier he’s had a blast for his birthday. Got a story?
