Sam Smith has posted another fierce video of them living their best life in a major US destination, and it’s gloriously spirited. The Unholy chart-topper, whose fourth studio album Gloria was released last month, has been over in the States this month ahead of their world tour kicking off in April. Following some headline grabbing appearances at both the Grammy Awards and the Brit Awards, where the 30-year-old rocked a David Bowie inspired latex outfit, the singer took to the streets of the Los Angeles in their usual singular style. Set to the sound of newly released single I’m Not Here to Make Friends, Sam, who is non-binary, showed themselves strutting along a pedestrian crossing in a black maxi dress, oversized blazer and square sunglasses. The performer was seen stopping to pose with one hand on their waist and their gold clutch bag held down by their side in the other, leaning back to reveal the impressively high platform heels they were wearing as they neared the pavement. The camera then panned to a seemingly unimpressed crossing patrol officer, chewing gum as he manned the intersection. Joking about the situation with a nice, related quip, Sam – who recently shared their dream of ‘ending their days as a fisher-them’ – posted in the caption: ‘Making friends 👅’ The star’s fans were loving their sassy video clip, with one posting: ‘Live your best life Sam, I love you 😍’ ‘They can’t manage all that hot sauce!!’ Loose Women star Judi Love added, alongside heart and heart-eye emoji. ‘Crosswalk QUEEN,’ commented another fan, while others were tickled by the policeman’s reaction. The joyous clip came shortly after a shocking video of Sam being screamed at by a stranger in New York surfaced, accusing them of being ‘demonic’ and subjecting them to a torrent of expletives and abuse. The singer-songwriter did not respond to the heckles and continued walking, however at one point appeared to also be filming the person shouting at them. Sam was hit with both abuse and support for their recent sets at the Grammys and Brits, garnering both Ofcom and FCC complaints for the performances, which featured a crew of backing dancers, car props on stage and a passionate kiss between two dancers at the end. However, they have also found lots of support, including from fellow musician Adam Lambert who praised his pal Sam ‘for helping everybody else out there be exactly who they should be’. Sam was also seen out and about last week with rumoured boyfriend Christian Cowan, grabbing coffee and engaging in conversation while exploring the Big Apple. The Stay With Me singer hasn’t publicly commented on speculation that they are loved up with fashion designer Christian. However, they were spotted with his parents in NYC last week, as Sam supported the designer by sitting front row at his Fashion Week show. They’ve also been photographed together on several occasions over the past few months. Got a story?
