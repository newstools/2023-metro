The stars have lost their spikes today and turned into a load of squishy, mushy love hearts for everyone’s least and most favourite day of the year: Valentine’s Day. We’ve had some cracking heartfelt tributes so far from The Beckhams, new mums Stacey Dooley and Molly-Mae Hague, as well as a few words of advice from the one and only Gemma Collins. The Beckhams kicked things off in a very cute way early doors, with David rolling out of bed (or scrolling in bed) to post a 7am picture of him and Victoria aka Posh Spice back in the days when he was a footballer and sported those iconic blonde tips. Tagging their kids in the post too, David wrote: ‘Happy Valentines to my valentine 🌹 we Love You @victoriabeckham.. ❤️ ❤️’ A few hours later, Victoria responded with an equally cute blast from the past, in which the pair are seen hugging in two shots from a similar timeframe. The fashion megastar captioned it with: ’26 years and still my Valentine, I love you so much @davidbeckham 💕💕💕💕 kisses.’ Aw, can we be part of this? Please? Elsewhere, there was a lot of new mum love as Stacey Dooley debuted her newborn in a seriously adorable video in which her husband, former Strictly dancer Kevin Clifton, made funny faces at little Minnie, who wore a jumper with her name on the back. The documentary maker and Strictly Come Dancing alumni, wrote: ‘My Valentines 💘 The loves of my life. 🏹🏹 I dunno what I did to get SO lucky. 🥺 To the best dad and man in the world ….. happy vally’s darlin. Ps….. you’re on nights when u get home from tour 🤪.’ Molly-Mae, who also just welcomed her daughter Bambi into the world with Love Island co-star Tommy Fury, went all out for the, er, big day and even, like a stocking on Christmas Eve, hung up her tot’s love heart outfit yesterday in preparation. The 23-year-old PrettyLittleThing creative director also posted a picture of little Bambi resting on Tommy’s chest, and captioned it with: ‘When you think you couldn’t love your bf any more and then…’ The Love Island star also shared a snap of her and Tommy looking all loved up and another of the professional boxer smiling at the camera, which she captioned with some cute words: ‘Happy Valentine’s Day to the boy that makes my world go round. I can’t believe I get to wake up to your face forever.’ Made In Chelsea sweethearts Millie Mackintosh and Hugo Taylor also seem to be enjoying Valentine’s Day after welcoming two children together over the last few years. Hugo took to social media with an adorable picture of the pair kissing in the sea, and said (in the sweetest post yet): ‘Love is pure happiness, obsession, someone you can’t live without. I’ve felt this way about you since the day we met over 20 years ago. Happy Valentine’s Day @milliemackintosh 😍😘🔥⚡️⭐️.’ Meanwhile, in the land of Gemma Collins – in which we all crave to be – there’s a whole lot of self-love going on and some priceless advice. Captioning a video of the one and only GC sipping on some bubbly to the happy tune of This Will Be by Natalie Cole, the icon wrote with many shouty capital letters: ‘THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP YOU WILL HAVE 🌹 is with YOURSELF 🌹LOVE YOURSELF 🌹 HAPPY VALENTINES and remember you must be your own greatest love of all 🌹 …. ‘To anyone feeling low today don’t worry you got this 🌹 but a bit of advice don’t listen to Miley today !!! About buying your own flowers let’s be fair it’s nicer when someone buys them for you 🌹.’ Here, here. Love Island’s Liberty Poole also shared some positivity with a post encouraging people to love their bodies and ‘normalise imperfections on social media’. The star posted two pictures of her in lingerie; one poised in her most flattering angle, and another of her tummy squished up to demonstrate how different photos of the same body can look. She wrote: ‘Happy Valentines – Love your body and normalise imperfections on social media❤️Couldn’t think of a better day to accept every part of ourselves! ‘My tummy has always been one of my biggest insecurities it’s where I gain weight and I suffer with being very bloated at times. But you know what that’s normal ! So we shouldn’t be made to feel like it isn’t. ‘Growing up and still to this day sometimes I still feel the need to look picture perfect but it isn’t day to day life. We have good days, bad days and all the days in-between. ‘I felt like I had to lose weight to fit in with the low waist skirt and cargo fashion trend otherwise people would stare at my tummy and assume I was pregnant or comment on it . And you know what I went out in low waist the other day and didn’t care !! Everyday I choose me over anyone so I owe it to myself to love every part of me to posed and unposed . If I can do it YOU can too . Love you all Lib ❤️’. Cristiano Ronaldo was another celeb to honour his beau Georgina Rodríguez, as he wrote, ‘Happy Valentine’s Day meu amor! So lucky to have you in my life!❤️’, alongside a snap of the pair looking all smiles. Got a story?
