EastEnders has been must-see TV as of late, and that’s very much set to continue next week, with more big developments on the cards for the show’s mainstays. Fancy a first look at what’s coming up? We thought you might, so we’ve got this special picture gallery, just for you. Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) is called into Lexi’s (Isabella Brown) school following reports that an unknown adult has attacked Lexi’s school friend Maisie for picking on her about her mum’s ailing health. Fearing her newfound online presence is to blame, Lola begins to fear for family’s safety – that is, until ‘Nicole’s true identity is revealed, which turns her world upside down. Suki Panesar (Balvinder Sopal), meanwhile, warns Nish (Navin Chowdhry) to stay away from the Mitchells, but he ignores her advice and enlists the help of son Vinny (Shiv Jalota), and together, they form a plan to wage war on Phil (Steve McFadden). Phil, horrified, makes an accusation against Nish. Suki jumps to her husband’s defence, giving him an alibi, but the Mitchell hard-man retaliates by turning the Minute Mart upside down, leaving the Panesars rattled. Elsewhere in the Square, Zack Hudson (James Farrar) starts his HIV medication, riddled with guilt that he hasn’t shared his diagnosis with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), who is reeling from the recent news about baby’s health. Following words of reassurance, Zack convinces Whitney to visit the hospital for additional testing.
