If you love a freebie, you’re in luck. Iceland and The Food Warehouse have partnered with Aunt Bessie’s to give away free roast dinners to lucky customers in store and online. Running from now until Friday February 17, customers who purchase the £12 Auntie Bessie roast bundle could be randomly selected to get the entire dinner for free. All you have to do is head to the checkout with the deal – which includes one meat joint and three sides or desserts – and see if you’re in for a chance to get it for free. Customers who purchase the Aunt Bessie’s deal online will find out on Random Acts of Kindness Day, which is this Friday, if they’re receiving the money back as a refund. The initiative was launched after research revealed that more than half of Brits plan on cutting down on their hot dinners – due to the cost of living. In Prestwich, happy customers at an Iceland store were some of the first to be randomly selected to win their roast dinner. ‘It’s nice to know that people were looking out for us today – it was totally unexpected,’ said 30-year-old Chelsea Burgess. While 52-year-old June Burrows described her free roast dinner as a ‘nice surprise.’ ‘This will make a lovely meal for me and the kids – I can’t wait,’ she said. An Iceland spokesperson commented: ‘Random Acts of Kindness Day is such a great way to celebrate our communities, but we want to extend our ‘random roasts of kindness’ for a little longer than one day.’ ‘We are proud of the fantastic store staff who really know our customers best –  it makes sense to leave the giveaways to them.’ Do you have a story to share?
