Nearly 90 people have been killed or injured after a tour bus fell off a bridge into a swollen river when it crashed into a security van. The bus was involved in a head-on collision with the cash-in-transit vehicle along a motorway near the South African town of Louis Trichardt. At least 20 people were killed and another 68 injured when it rolled off the bridge, landing in its side in a river below. Efforts to recover the passengers are being hampered by extremely heavy rain across the northern province of Limpopo. Paramedics said most of the fatalities had been trapped under the tour bus. An ambulance spokesperson said: ‘Three people were found deceased by the roadside and 16 down by the river – all were declared dead on arrival. ‘One patient, of the 69 passengers confirmed transported to hospital for various injuries, has since died.’ It was not immediately clear how many people were on the bus when it crashed. ER24, the private ambulance company that went to the scene, said police were investigating the circumstances of the crash, which happened around 8pm. Limpopo was one of seven South African provinces to be hit by widespread flooding in recent days, as the La Nina weather phenomenon hits the country. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster yesterday, with his office saying homes and vehicles had been flooded and basic infrastructure had been lost. It was the second time Mr Ramaphosa had made such a declaration in less than a week. He also invoked the disaster law on February 9, in reaction to a series of crippling energy shortages that have resulted in daily rolling power cuts.
