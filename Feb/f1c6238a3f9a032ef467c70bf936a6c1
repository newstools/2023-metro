The Princess of Wales rewore a £460 coat from Max&Co, previously seen last year as part of an all camel ensemble. The longline coat is minimalist in design, featuring no buttons or hardware accents. And while a neutral coat is somewhat of a signature look for Kate, she paired it with an on trend colour blocking outfit, featuring navy wide leg trousers, a navy turtle neck, and matching handbag. The $420 (approximately £350) structured blue bag is the work of luxury French brand, Polène Paris, and features a gold clasp and chain. And, after her high-street £18 Zara earrings caused a frenzy at the BAFTAs over the weekend, Kate has proved she is in her ‘earring era’ with a pair of large blue and gold studs, that are giving strong regencycore vibes. The look was finished off with a classic bouncy blow dry and minimal makeup. The royal is set to meet with staff and residents at Oxford Nursing Home, in Slough, to learn about how delivering high-quality, patient-focused care is at the centre of the home’s work. And never one to shy away from a challenge, Kate will also be making pancakes to mark Shrove Tuesday. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
