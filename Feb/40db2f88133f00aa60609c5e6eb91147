Freezing temperatures and thick fog has caused travel chaos for huge parts of the UK this morning. Twenty-three departing and arriving flights were cancelled at London City Airport, including those bound for Amsterdam and Florence. Temperatures in the capital dropped to as low as -4C overnight and Londoners woke to dense fog. Dozens of other flights been delayed, including a flight to Geneva, and arriving flights from Frankfurt and Glasgow are expected to be late. The airport said it is hopeful the freezing fog will lift later this morning but knock-on delays will be likely, and passengers should check with their airline before they travel. British Airways cancelled inbound flights to the Docklands airport from Amsterdam, Berlin, Dublin, Dusseldorf and Rotterdam. Another arrival, BA8731 from Frankfurt, appears to be heading to Gatwick after holding for more than 30 minutes over the North Sea. KLM axed its first two morning flights from Amsterdam, while Lufthansa grounded one arrival from Frankfurt. Last month thousands of travellers from Heathrow Airport were left stranded after their fights were cancelled due to the ice cold weather. Planes were being ‘de-iced’ at Gatwick Airport for safety but the airport said there were no significant weather issues affecting flights. Passengers travelling to the airport were being warned to make sure windows are ice free. Heathrow Airport said there were foggy conditions but flights were arriving and departing as planned, while Stansted Airport said there were some delays due to fog but no cancellations. London City is effectively at sea level, adjacent to the River Thames, and is often affected by poor visibility. The airport is classed as ‘Category 3’ – meaning pilots receive special training to land, due to the steep approach. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
