Both Manchester United and Leeds have ‘strongly condemned’ their fans after chants regarding historic tragedies were heard during Sunday’s match. United claimed a 2-0 win at Elland Road, thanks to late goals from Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho. The two sides are of course historic rivals but things escalated to a ‘completely unacceptable’ level during the Premier League clash. It is reported that some Leeds fans began singing about the 1958 Munich air disaster, where 23 people, including 11 United players and coaching staff, lost their lives. In response, the Red Devils’ travelling supporters chanted ‘Istanbul’ referring to the 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence, where two Leeds fans were murdered by Galatasaray fans. As Sunday’s game came to close, both club’s jointly released the following statement: ‘Both clubs strongly condemn chanting from both sets of fans regarding historic tragedies at today’s game. ‘Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and we will continue to work together with our respective fan groups and the Premier League, and other authorities on eradicating it from football.’ The Premier League itself also put out their own statement, adding: ‘The Premier League condemns the chanting heard during today’s match between Leeds United and Manchester United. ‘The League is treating the issue of tragedy chanting as a priority and as a matter of urgency.’ Following the result of the match, United moved up to second in the table, while manager-less Leeds remain 17th, just one point above the relegation zone.
