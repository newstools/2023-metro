London underground workers and civil servants are taking to the picket line today. Staff at the Department for Work and Pensions are striking across Universal Credit centres. In the last month, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers, rail workers, taxi drivers, civil servants, barristers and bus drivers have all taken industrial action. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents many government workers, says the job action is a ‘response to the lack of movement from the Government on their demands on pay, pensions and job security’. Job security and redundancy terms are two of the biggest reasons for the strike, with the union pointing to Government plans to close more than 40 DWP offices. Workers in Liverpool – at Toxteth Jobcentre, Liverpool Duke Street Jobcentre, Liverpool City Jobcentre and Liverpool Innovation Park Jobcentre – are walking out. Stockport Contact Centre and Bolton Benefit Centre staff will do so too. Aslef London Underground workers are also striking on the Bakerloo line today. All other Transport for London services are running as normal. The workers are walking out over cost-cutting measures that could stop tube carriages from being checked for passengers before going into sidings and depots. This could mean passengers are left stranded in tube depots. Finn Brennan, Aslef district organiser for London, said: ‘Previous experience had shown that removing physical checks means that thousands of passengers are unwittingly taken into sidings or depots. ‘We understand the pressure that London Underground is under to cut costs, but this cannot be at the expense of the safety of passengers and staff.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
