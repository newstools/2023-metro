This is the terrifying moment a ferris wheel breaks down leaving riders dangling upside down. Footage from Rajmahal, eastern India, shows four people in the carriage when it malfunctions, three of them lying down and a fourth stood up. It swings dangerously as people below try to help them down, while other carriages appear unaffected. The cart then breaks away from the ride as it approaches the ground. One particularly distressing moment happened when the wheel began to move again just as the stranded riders were clinging to it. It is not clear if any of them sustained injuries in yesterdayâ€™s incident. Visitors to a Chinese amusement park were also recently left stranded upside down. The nightmarish experience took place in Funan County, Anhui Province, when a pendulum ride came to an abrupt stop, leaving people stuck 10 metres in the air. They were forced to anxiously wait for mechanics to rush to the scene and fix the problem. The trapped riders were upside down for around 10 minutes.
