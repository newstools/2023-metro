Casa Amor 2023 is finally upon us, and this year’s Love Island contestants certainly know the drill – with the girls toasting to their newfound freedom during Sunday night’s episode and hinting at some rather spicy antics to come. As Jessie, Tanya, Samie, Olivia and Claudia are whizzed off to a brand-new villa where six new hunks await their arrival, Will, Shaq, Tom, Kai and Ron remain in the OG villa where they’ll be joined by new bombshells. Making themselves at home in Casa, the girls chant: ‘What happens in Casa Amor stays in Casa Amor’ and add: ‘When the cat’s away, the mice will play,’ suggesting we could be in for some explosive recouplings. Back in the main villa, the boys start to wonder where on earth the girls are, until they receive a text confirming their worst fears. The text reads: ‘Boys, the girls have gone away for a few nights, please now pack them a case for their trip #GoneForAGoodTimeNotALongTime #CasaAmor.’ Meanwhile, settling into their new digs, the girls get their own text that says: ‘Girls, welcome to Casa Amor you will have six new boys to get to know. Please get ready to meet Maxwell, Frankie, Bayley, Martin, Kain and Ryan #GirlsOnJob #TimeForAmorBoys.’ The girls are getting ready for what they think is a normal night busting moves by the pool when Samie gets a text saying: ‘Girls, shush keep it quiet it’s time for you to sneak out of the Villa as you are off on a girly getaway, grab any essentials and please leave the Villa immediately #MakeABreakForIt #CasaAmor.’ They waste no time rushing out the villa in just their dressing gowns and armed with only a handful of belongings, while alarm bells start ringing for the boys when Shaq happens upon the girls’ empty dressing room. ‘No, no, no! Boys…the girls are gone,’ Shaq says as he runs back down to the boys, who rush outside in search of the girls. One thing’s for sure: tonight’s Love Island episode might just be this season’s most interesting yet. Love Island airs tonight at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. Got a story?
