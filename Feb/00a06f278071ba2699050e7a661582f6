Whether you prefer them thick or thin, stacked high or solo, there are all kinds of ways to enjoy pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. Not only is it an opportunity to get creative with toppings, but also to ditch regular meals for pancakes. But a lot of the enjoyment relies on whether you can master the perfect pancake flip. One wrong move and you’ll be left with a sad, creased mess on the kitchen floor. So how can you harness your skills this Pancake Day? Thankfully, chef Lisa Marley (@lisamarleychef) has come through with the goods. She’s shared how to perfect the ultimate pancake toss – so you can flip with ease. Lisa says there are a few things that are key in the preparation process. After all, fail to prepare, prepare to fail. First up, she explains that a non-stick pan is essential when it comes to your pancake station. The next top tip is to let your mixture rest for five minutes before frying – regardless of whether you’re using plant-based batter or one with dairy. Following this, make sure your frying pan is piping hot before you add butter or oil. In her video, Lisa says to swirl the batter around when it’s in the pan. Once you see bubbles form, give the pan a little shake to lift the pancake away from the bottom. This is when you know you’re good to toss. In terms of the flip itself, Lisa adds: ‘It’s all in the wrist action. Firm and fast.’ So, there you have it. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
