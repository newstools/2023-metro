A man almost blew up half of his village after he decided to decorate his house with grenades – before realising they still worked. Police and emergency services were called to Summercourt, Cornwall, on Tuesday afternoon with officers shutting down major roads and a bus garage. Devon and Cornwall Police were carrying out a routine visit to the house when it was found that the man had decorated his home with grenades without realising that they were indeed live. The grenades were removed and disposed of by a bomb squad nearby. The man explained to officers that he had bought the hand grenades for ‘decorative’ purposes and didn’t realise they were live. Cops said the man will face no further action. A police spokesperson said: ‘Officers found three suspected hand-grenades inside a property in Summercourt, Cornwall, while carrying out a routine call at about 11.20am on Tuesday, 31 January. ‘The Royal Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team was called to assess the items. ‘A local road closure and a 50-metre cordon were put in place, and a nearby property was evacuated as a precaution. ‘The suspected hand-grenades were removed by the EOD team to be safely disposed of. The road was reopened at 2.30pm. ‘Officers spoke to the owner of the property, who told them he had bought the items in good faith for decorative purposes and did not believe they were live. No further policing action will be taken.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
