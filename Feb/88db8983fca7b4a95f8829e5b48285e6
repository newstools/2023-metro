A shopper was ‘knocked out cold’ while waiting outside a trainer shop for the latest Nike Jordans. Customers were in line outside Size? on Market Street, Manchester, ahead of the first day of sales for the Air Jordan 4 SE Craft Photon Dust – which cost £275. Many had shown up the evening before to reserve their place in the queue, with staff handing out numbers to confirm their spots on Saturday. But a fight soon broke out after more people began to join. Footage shows a large crowd outside the shop, before swearing can be heard and a man falls to the ground. He is then kicked in the head, and was allegedly ‘knocked out cold’. A source told Manchester Evening News: ‘A group of people came at 8pm the night before and they made a non-official list to who is first in the queue, and they agreed to come back at 6am. ‘Between those times, people joined the queue and when the people on the list came an argument ensued because they thought it was unfair which resulted in what happened in the video. ‘I want it to be clear, no one got “robbed”, this was not a racist attack either.’ Greater Manchester Police told MEN it did not appear anyone had reported any assault. Nike Air Jordans, named after the famous basketball player Michael Jordan, is one of the most popular brand of trainers. In 2018, Nike gained $2.9billion in revenue from the Jordan brand. Their latest release consist of a suede body with a leather base layer. Metro.co.uk has approached Greater Manchester Police and Size? for comment.
