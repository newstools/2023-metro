The National Lottery has revealed where two unclaimed tickets – worth a whopping £1,000,000 each – were bought. The winning EuroMillions tickets were purchased in North Somerset and South Ayrshire for the draw on Friday February 3. Players are now being urged to double check their unique code, found at the bottom of their tickets. The code for the North Somerset ticket is XFHF 13164, while the code for the South Ayrshire is XGHX 51373. Both ticket-holders have until August 2 to claim their prizes. Anyone who is not in possession of their ticket but believes they have a genuine claim can write to Camelot within 30 days of the draw. Andy Carter, from the National Lottery, said: ‘A total of 31 UK millionaires were made in the special EuroMillions European Millionaire Maker draw on February 3 and we’ve already started to support the 29 ticket-holders who have claimed their prizes. ‘We’re now urging everyone who bought a ticket in one of these two remaining areas to check their old EuroMillions tickets again or look anywhere a missing ticket could be hiding.’ Meanwhile, a mum has claimed the National Lottery is ‘fobbing her off’ over a missing £30. Gemma Murray says she’s been left ‘out of pocket’ after she failed to receive her prize. Each month, she uses the lottery app to take part on behalf of herself and her mum. Gemma won £30 in October and had been excited to cash out the prize money. She told the Liverpool Echo: ‘Every month when we get paid, me and my mum put the lottery on for the month. She won three numbers – £30 – so I withdrew it from the account and we were told we’d get it by November 2, but we still haven’t had it.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
