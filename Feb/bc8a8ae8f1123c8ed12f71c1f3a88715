Emma Mackey has confirmed her exit from Sex Education ahead of the release of season 4. Mackey will return as Maeve Wiley in the upcoming next chapter of Sex Education, but it will be her last stint as the teen sex therapist who set up a counselling company for her school mates alongside Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield). After collecting her Bafta for the Rising Star award on Sunday night, which caused her co-star Aimee Lou Wood to burst into tears, Mackey was asked if she’ll be appearing in a potential fifth series of Sex Education. ‘B****y hell, I just finished the fourth one last week!’ she replied. ‘No, I don’t think so. I think I’ve said goodbye to it. It’s a happy goodbye though.’ Mackey’s exit comes hot off the heels of Ncuti Gatwa’s departure too. The Eric Effiong actor confirmed he’d quit Sex Education ahead of his first tint as the new doctor in Doctor Who. Earlier this month he confirmed his exit after filming his final scene as Eric, sharing a photo with fans. Alongside it, he wrote: ‘Last day. Last time. Bye bubs, thank you for all the lessons and for all the strength.’ Several Sex Education stars have already confirmed they won’t even be back for season four, with Tanya Reynolds, Simone Ashley, Patricia Allison and Rakhee Thakrar all bowing out. However, season four promises to be a corker already with Schitt’s Creek icon Dan Levy joining the series as Thomas Molly, a US Ivy League tutor for Maeve. Sex Education is expected to return to Netflix later this year. Got a story?
