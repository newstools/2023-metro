Deontay Wilder believes Jake Paul beat Tommy Fury and has blamed the referee for deducting a point against the American. Fury emerged with a split-decision victory in Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening with two judges scoring the contest 76-73, while the other judge scored the contest 75-74 in Paul’s favour. Wilder, meanwhile, was ringside in Riyadh to watch the fight and even met Tyson Fury for the first time since their trilogy in October 2021. And the Bronze Bomber believes Paul did enough to outscore Fury in their scrappy fight. ‘I think Jake got that one,’ Wilder told Fight Hub TV. ‘That referee, that was an immature taken. I think Jake Paul needed that knockdown and when he did it evened it out. ‘I think he only gave it to Fury because of the point taken. ‘It was an immature point, the referee is supposed to give him at least three warnings, he gave him no warnings, get out of here. ‘I think so [Jake Paul should have won], I think so, with the knockdown he sealed it in, but it was a good scrap all the way through.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
