The original Magic Mike was a slightly gritty drama touching on the feel-bads of being a male stripper. It was followed by Magic Mike XXL aka the ‘fun one’ – more sexy dancing, less angst. And now, seven years on, we get a final cash-grab threequel that roundly tickled my ‘so bad it’s good’ sweet spot. Fans of the franchise will obviously wonder what happened to Mike’s budding furniture-making company. Well, it folded, leaving our still insanely ripped 40-year-old ex-stripper (Channing Tatum) surviving on dead-end barman gigs, until he’s offered cash to give a ‘last dance’ to a filthy-rich lady called Max (Salma Hayek Pinault). Max then whisks him away to a hilariously caricatured London. Here Max gets Mike to create his own West End male stripper show (where, mysteriously, no one actually strips) for revenge against her ex-husband – or something. The script is completely bananas. Tatum gets to say, ‘I don’t f*** with vegetables’ while picking cucumber out of his sandwiches. Both he and Hayek Pinault are sensational to watch, but their spray tans have more depth than their characters. Mike’s show looks about as coherent as the movie itself – both of which, we are repeatedly told, are about giving women what they really want. But do they? I’m still clueless as to what Max really wants. In fact, Magic Mike 3 is actually a Fifty Shades in reverse for Mike, who gets all his fantasies fulfilled by a hot multimillionairess. If you just want a giggle and a goggle at racks of six-packs while Tatum channels his inner ‘magical unicorn’ then this film is for you. But mainly, it feels like your brain’s being given a very drunken lap dance. Magic Mike’s Last Dance is out in cinemas in February 9.
