A 20-day-old baby has been pulled alive from earthquake rubble in Turkey. Rescuers were photographed holding baby boy Kerem Agirtas as they searched for survivors after earthquakes killed nearly 12,000 people across Turkey and Syria. The infant was rescued from the rubble in Hatay, southern Turkey. It is not known whether any of his family members survived the disaster. The magnitude 7.8 quake toppled entire apartment blocks, wrecked hospitals, and left thousands of people injured or homeless in the winter cold on Monday. It was one of the most powerful and deadly earthquakes to hit Turkey and Syria in decades, one followed by an aftershock almost as big felt in nearby countries. Time is now running out to save families still unaccounted for after their homes collapsed on top of them while they slept. Temperatures fell close to freezing overnight, hampering the rescue efforts and worsening conditions for those yet to be rescued. On top of the challenging weather, rescuers are digging through rubble amid power cuts and key roads left unusable roads after being buckled by the tremors. Across Hatay province, just southwest of the earthquake’s epicentre in Gaziantep, officials say as many as 1,500 buildings were destroyed and many people reported relatives being trapped under the rubble with no aid or rescue teams arriving. Nurgul Atay said she could hear her mother’s voice beneath the rubble of a collapsed building in the city of Antakya, the capital of Hatay. But without the help of a rescue crew or heavy equipment, their efforts to save her have been futile. Another resident, who gave his name as Deniz, said: ‘They’re making noises but nobody is coming. ‘We’re devastated, we’re devastated. My God … They’re calling out. They’re saying, “Save us”, but we can’t save them. ‘How are we going to save them? There has been nobody since the morning.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
