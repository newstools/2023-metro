A mum is staging a one-family boycott after she found a strand of plastic in her 89p bacon from Tesco. Taria Cornelius said she will never go to the supermarket again after finding the foreign object in her food cooking breakfast with her son Bradley, 16. She fears that had he not spotted it, the plastic ‘could have sent the kids to hospital as it was a chocking hazard’. She said: ‘It was only 89p, so not very expensive, but that’s not the point. ‘There is a lot of it and I have another pack in the freezer that I’m too scared to cook now in case. ‘I don’t know if other people got hold of it too but it is quite a dangerous thing, and I reckon it should be recalled.’ The Surrey mum contacted Tesco and asked for a refund, but was told the only way that would be possible would be to bring the bacon into the store herself. She said: ‘I don’t drive, and my husband is disabled. We live in Chilworth. I had ordered the bacon as part of my online food shop. ‘If I was to get to Tesco I’d have to get the train to the Park Barn superstore in Guildford. It would end up costing me more to get the train there for the refund.’ After explaining her situation to Tesco, Taria claims she got the same response. She added: ‘Tesco just don’t care and I am never shopping there again. I have contacted the Food Standards Agency to look into it.’ A Tesco spokesperson said: ‘We’re sorry to hear about this. If a customer is not satisfied with a product, they can always return it to us for a full refund.’ Here’s a handy guide on what you should do if you find a foreign object in your food.
