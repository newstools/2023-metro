Kyle Jacobs, the husband of country singer Kellie Pickler, has died at the age of 49 after apparently taking his own life, it’s been reported. In a statement released by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, in the early hours of the morning on Friday, a 911 call was made from a home in the US city. Jacobs, a country music songwriter, is said to have been found in an upstairs bedroom or office after reportedly taking his own life, with the police force stating that his death is being ‘investigated as an apparent suicide’. ‘Mr. Jacobs’ wife, Kellie Pickler, reported that she awoke a short time earlier, did not see her husband, and began looking for him. After she and her personal assistant were unable to open the door to the upstairs bedroom/office, the assistant telephoned 911,’ the statement obtained by Variety read. Former American Idol star Pickler, 36, and Jacobs became engaged in 2010 after two and a half years of dating, before eloping on New Year’s Day in 2011. They were married in a ‘small, intimate ceremony on a private island in the Caribbean’, with Pickler saying after their nuptials that it was ‘the most spiritual moment’. Jacobs, who was also a vocalist, guitarist and pianist, worked as a staff writer for Curb Music. Hailing from Bloomington, Minnesota, he worked on famous hits including Garth Brooks’ More Than a Memory, Kimberley Locke’s 8th World Wonder, as well as having songs recorded by artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Tim McGraw, Craig Morgan and Trace Adkins. In 2015, Pickler and Jacobs’ reality show, titled I Love Kellie Pickler, premiered on CMT. Tributes have poured in for Jacobs following his death, with Paula Abdul writing on Twitter: ‘My heart is broken for you @kelliepickler. I’m sending you comfort & strength during this unimaginable time. I love you & am here for you 🤍 Rest In Peace #KyleJacobs 🙏🏼 If you or someone you know is struggling, call #988 to reach the Suicide Prevention Lifeline @988Lifeline 24/7.’ Director Jade Ellis shared: ‘In 2016, I had the opportunity to direct I Love Kellie Pickler. I didn’t know anything about Kyle Jacobs, but within seconds of meeting him all I felt was warmth and love. Always had a smile, always ready with a joke. I’m speechless that he’s no longer here. Praying for KP.’ Someone else said: ‘My deepest condolences to Kellie Pickler, friends and family on the tragic loss of their loved one, Kyle Jacobs. Call #988 if you need help with life challenges.
