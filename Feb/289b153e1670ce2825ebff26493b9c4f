A drug dealer was followed by police for a year – but they mainly saw him collecting Pokémon. Raymond Phipps, 41, was a cocaine ‘fixer’ who pursued as part of a 12-month investigation into a ‘well-organised’ drug gang. But most of the movements police tracked involved Phipps, from Basingstoke, playing the video game Pokémon Go, a court heard The hugely popular mobile game sees players virtually ‘catch’ and ‘battle’ creatures by travelling to different real-world locations. The dad has now been jailed for five years for his role in the cocaine gang, which supplied the class A substance in Andover and Basingstoke between December 2019 and December 2020. Phipps was one of seven people convicted on drugs charges, five of whom were previously jailed for more than 20 years. The drugs operation was described as ‘effective, efficient and well-organised’, with fixer Phipps serving as the ‘middleman’. The dad was also caught with £13,350 cash in a Morrisons carrier bag, which he claimed was a wedding gift from his grandmother. Judge Nicholas Haggan said it was a ‘highly sophisticated and well-organised operation’ which involved the use of multiple mobile phones and numbers. The judge told him: ‘The offences you have committed are so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community penalty can be justified. ‘However, having considered your personal mitigations with regard to your health, and the length of time you were waiting for the trial, I order you to a term of five years in prison.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
