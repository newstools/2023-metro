Andy Murray is looking forward to a ‘big test’ after reaching his first semi-final in eight months with victory over Alexandre Muller at the Qatar Open. British hero Murray produced an impressive comeback to win 4-6 6-1 6-2 against the French qualifier as he improved his record to 5-0 in deciding sets in 2023. It is the first ATP Tour semi-final for the 35-year-old former world No.1 since June, when he finished as a runner-up at the Stuttgart Open. Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray – who plays with a metal hip – will next face Jiri Lehecka as he looks to win the Qatar Open for the third time in his career. Speaking after his victory over Muller at the 250 Series event on Thursday, Murray said: ‘I had to start going for my shots a lot more. ‘In the first set, I wasn’t doing enough with the ball, he was dictating the points and making me run. ‘I’ve played a lot of tennis the past few months, so that didn’t give me the best chance to win. ‘I became more attacking, came to the net more when I had the chance to step up. ‘He [Muller] has had an excellent tournament, coming through qualifying. ‘He’s had good wins over years, beating Gasquet and Tsonga, so I knew it would be a tough match. ‘He plays very well and with more experience, hopefully he will be here more often.’ On his next opponent Lehecka, Murray added: ‘He started the year extremely well and did very well at the Australian Open. ‘He’s one of best young players on the tour. A great ball-striker, so it will be a big test for me but hopefully I can put in a good performance.’ Lehecka enjoyed a run to the Australian Open quarter-finals last month while Murray – who won a five-hour-and-45-minute thriller against Thanasi Kokkinakis – lost in the third round to Spanish star Roberto Bautista Agut.
