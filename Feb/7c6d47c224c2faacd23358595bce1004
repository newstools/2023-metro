Pranksters have poked fun at the Prime Minister by putting up a blue plaque to commemorate the spot he was filmed not wearing a seatbelt. Naughty Rishi Sunak was caught breaking the law and received a fixed penalty notice after posting the clip of himself to Instagram not wearing a seatbelt in Blackpool. The plaque mimics the official versions commissioned by English Heritage to mark culturally important sites around the country. It reads: ‘Rishi Sunak 19-01-23 received a fixed penalty notice for being filmed passing Squires Gate Lane while not wearing a seatbelt during his visit to Blackpool.’ It is not yet known who built the plaque which is located near Blackpool Airport. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Sunak made a ‘brief error of judgement’ by removing his seatbelt as he whizzed around Lancashire on January 19. ‘He fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised,’ the spokesperson added. Lancashire Police did not reveal the price of the fine but fixed penalty notices for seatbelt offences are usually £100, rising to £500 if taken to court. A force spokesperson said: ‘You will be aware that a video has been circulating on social media showing an individual failing to wear a seatbelt. ‘After looking into this matter, we have today issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of fixed penalty.’ This is not the first time Blackpool has poked fun at a Tory PM. Last July, Boris Johnson’s waxwork display from Madame Tussauds in Blackpool was positioned outside a job centre following his resignation.
