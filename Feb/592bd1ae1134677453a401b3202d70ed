A man went out on a crime spree less than a day after being spared jail for a spate of thefts. Lewis Isley, 44, of Hallow, Worcestershire, had dodged prison time for a raft of burglary and theft offences on the condition that he’d be taken into custody if he committed another crime within 15 months. The very next day, Isley broke into a Worcester Subway branch, using a bin to smash his way into the premises while under the influence. Finding there was no money in the till, he threw stock around the shop. Worcester Magistrates’ Court heard how a member of the public saw Isley crawl out of the Subway branch and attempt to run off after the police arrived. Upon being detained, Isley then bit one of the arresting officers. Prosecutor Asiefna Adams said: ‘The defendant was clearly unsteady on his feet, stumbling over himself. ‘Police took him to the floor restraining him. PC Victoria Burns felt a sharp pain and saw the defendant’s mouth on her left leg.’ Adams added there were bite marks on Burns’ leg, who was in turn sent to Worcestershire Royal Hospital for treatment. Isley later told officers he’d been so intoxicated he had no memory of the incident. A father of one, Isely, who already has an extensive criminal record, subsequently admitted to burglary and assaulting an emergency worker. The defence asked that the magistrates’ court give Isley credit for being upfront about his conduct, and added that he had ‘no complaints’ about being jailed. Barry Newton, defending, pointed out that Isley had prospects of rehabilitation, having worked as an estate agent during the 2000s before relapsing into substance abuse. Isley’s sentence for his previous offending was nevertheless activated. He will serve 12 months in prison. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
