The star is so delighted with the collaboration she couldn’t resist sharing a snap of herself in one of her latest creations ahead of the Daisy Jones and The Six premiere on Thursday night. Of the collection, Dawn said: ‘I know that most people don’t want to spend hours trawling in vintage shops like I do, so I’ve taken the best of my archive and turned them into wearable and totally unique dresses that can be enjoyed by everyone.’ The colourful collection is made up of flattering cuts with bright florals and kaftan-style silhouettes as well as ‘big bold prints’. Dawn said of the new minidress: ‘This little denim shift was so popular last time that we have done THREE versions this time. The black is soft like butter, the multicolour buttons are cute as buttons. Tights, no tights. Boots or shoes. Colourfull lips or big eyes. Big hair or a ponytail. It all goes. I’ve been living in these, they’re so easy.’ Here are a few of our favourites:
