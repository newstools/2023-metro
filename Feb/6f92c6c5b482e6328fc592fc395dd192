A pair of students have got top marks after helping to rescue a dog who had fallen into a canal. Jack Spencer Furmston and Ben Camphor, both 20, were walking home from a coffee shop in Manchester when they spotted a pet owner in need of help. Batu Akyol was grasping the lead belonging to his dog that had unfortunately just fallen into the Ancoats Canal. A ‘crowd had begun to build’ and Ben decided to ‘spring into action’ as the tallest one among them. ‘Everyone was panicking. I couldn’t let that dog down and not help,’ Ben told MailOnline. Jack and five others held on tight to Ben’s legs while he dangled head-first over the wall bordering the canal. Dabhidh MchicEamailinn, who was walking on the other side of the water, spotted what was happening, filmed it and posted it on Tuesday. The footage caught the moments Ben grabbed the dog’s collar to help it reach the wall. He then reaches out and reaches the animal’s front legs. The rest of the group then give a massive heave to bring Ben and the dog to safety. Several spectators can be heard cheering in the clip as the rescue reaches its happening. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, reacted to the video on Twitter with clapping hands emojis. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
