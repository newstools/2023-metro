Paul Merson feared Arsenal were set to finish third in the Premier League this season prior to their 4-2 win over Aston Villa. The Gunners are on a title charge and were eight points clear of Manchester City last month, looking for their first top-flight trophy since 2004. But Mikel Arteta’s side suffered a recent poor spell in the Premier League, losing to struggling Everton before a home draw with Brentford. They then suffered a massive blow to their title hopes with a 3-1 defeat to City at the Emirates, a result which saw Pep Guardiola’s side leapfrog them at the top. The Gunners had been hoping to turn their fortunes around against Aston Villa but found themselves 2-1 down at half-time, before eventually turning it around to win 4-2 to return to the top of the table. Arsenal legend Merson, speaking ahead of the game, admitted that if his old club lost the match at Villa Park, they could have ended up finishing third this season. He told Sky Sports: ‘I said if they beat Man City, they would win the league. ‘If they win this game [against Aston Villa] they are still in the title race but if they lose this game, I would seriously be having a look at third at best. ‘That’s how quickly it changes. They look nervous.’ Gary Neville has long thought that Arsenal will finish third in the Premier League this term. Speaking in January, the former Manchester United defender said: ‘They won’t win the league. ‘Manchester City will win the league, and I think Man Utd will finish second, and I know that will annoy Arsenal fans. ‘At some point, there will be a very difficult period for Arsenal this season.’ MORE : Mikel Arteta explains decision to bench Gabriel Martinelli for Arsenal's clash with Villa MORE : Mikel Arteta hits back at claims Arsenal have been ‘figured out’ by low blocks
