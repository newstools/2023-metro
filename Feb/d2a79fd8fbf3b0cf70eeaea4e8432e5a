Chelsea manager Graham Potter admits he takes ‘full responsibility’ for the club’s form and says he ‘can’t rely’ on Todd Boehly’s support forever. The Blues collapsed to another demoralising defeat on Sunday afternoon with a 2-0 loss to rivals Tottenham in north London. The defeat leaves Chelsea in 10th and they’ve scored just once in their last 60 shots in the Premier League. Boehly has stuck by Potter, given it was his controversial decision to sack Thomas Tuchel and to hire the former Brighton boss after just six Premier League matches this term. But two wins in their last 15 matches has left Potter under severe pressure and today’s limp defeat has done little to quell suggestions that he’s not up to the job. Many have pointed to the unstable nature of Chelsea at this moment in time as reason for recent results, while the club’s spending has been difficult for Potter to navigate. But Potter says the club’s form is his ‘full responsibility’ and he admits he cannot take Boehly’s support for granted. ‘I take full responsibility for the results & it isn’t good enough for Chelsea,’ said Potter.‘We want to try & improve it and if results aren’t good enough, which they aren’t at the moment, you can’t rely on support forever that’s for sure. ‘My job is to keep going.’ Chelsea face Leeds next Saturday, before hosting Dortmund in their second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie. The Blues lost 1-0 in Germany in the first leg. For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
