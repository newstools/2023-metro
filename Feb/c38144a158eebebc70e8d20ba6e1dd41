The Queen Consort has tested positive for Covid after suffering from cold symptoms. It comes after Camilla, 75, was forced to cancel royal engagements planned for tomorrow. Her sickness was originally thought to be a ‘seasonal illness’. But Buckingham Palace announced this afternoon: ‘After suffering the symptoms of a cold, Her Majesty The Queen Consort has tested positive for the Covid virus. ‘With regret, she has therefore cancelled all her public engagements for this week and sends her sincere apologies to those who had been due to attend them.’ Camilla is said to be in good spirits and resting, while King Charles, 74, is understood to be in good health and is currently set to attend royal events this week. The monarch is expected to travel to Milton Keynes on Thursday to celebrate the spot becoming a city. The following day, he will hold a reception at Buckingham Palace in support of Global Biodiversity. The Queen Consort also suffered from coronavirus last March, while her husband has caught it twice before. Camilla was due to visit two locations in Telford, Shropshire on Tuesday. She was supposed to unveil a commemorative stone in the town square for Telford’s Veteran Trail, a charity that raises funds to support former Armed Forces service people by laying plaques for deceased soldiers and veterans. The 75-year-old was then due to go to the town’s leisure centre to meet staff and volunteers from local community groups, before concluding her visit with a meeting with Telford Veteran Trail’s founder, Erica Hanson.
