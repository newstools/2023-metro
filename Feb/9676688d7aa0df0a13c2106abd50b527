Will Mellor has expressed his pride in his physical transformation after all of his Strictly Come Dancing training, revealing he’s in the ‘best shape he’s been in years’. Last year, the Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps actor starred on the latest series of the BBC dance series, becoming the 10th celebrity to be eliminated with his professional partner Nancy Xu, just missing out on a place in the final. The 46-year-old took the judges and viewers at home by surprise with his smooth moves on the dancefloor, showing off his loose hips and achieving the top score in three weeks of the competition. He’s continued to delight fans while embarking on the Strictly live tour around the UK, and has now revealed the fruits of his labour after all of his dance training helped him to tone his ripped physique. Sharing a photo of himself from the waist up on Instagram, gazing at the camera, Will wrote: ‘Best shape I’ve been in for years!!! Thank you @bbcstrictly!’ He continued: ‘Not looking for compliments and never usually post stuff like this but I’m 46 and feel great so gonna try and keep it up. So good for my mental health as well!’ He also added the hashtags ‘#itsnevertoolatetostart’, ‘#stayingfit’, ‘#menshealth’ and ‘#mentalhealth’, while also linking to a mental health account on Instagram. Several people have praised him on his results, with fellow Strictly star Matt Goss commenting: ‘Looking great mate.’ ‘Wolalalalalal,’ wrote Nancy excitedly, while former actor Ryan Thomas said: ‘Marry me.’ In response to Will saying he doesn’t usually share content like this, one person replied: ‘Why the hell not, feeling good is part of our well being 🙌🏼 and looking good helps that.. well done for sharing.’ Another said that Will’s point about his physical transformation being good for his mental health is ‘amazing’. Earlier this year, the actor revealed that he lost so much weight on Strictly that his watch didn’t fit him anymore. Speaking on This Morning, he said: ‘My watch didn’t fit me! I didn’t know I had chunky wrists but I do! I lost weight everywhere.’ He added: ‘I think it’s probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done, work wise, just because of how consuming it is. You’re in this bubble and once you go into it, you don’t come out of it until you leave the show,’ he explained. ‘The one day off, all you’ll think about is, you’re resting yourself, you’re icing your knees, thinking about starting again tomorrow.’ Got a story?
