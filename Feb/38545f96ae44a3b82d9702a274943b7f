In this day and age, a low Uber rating is like a stab in the chest. If you didn’t hurl abuse at the driver, or, you know, throw up in the back seat, it’s hard to imagine why you’d receive a less than four star rating. It turns out, you can actually dig deeper on your overall rating and find out how many five star – or one star – reviews you’ve been given. Emma, a TikToker going by the name @emmatainment, shared a video earlier this week explaining how to find out the breakdown of your uber rating. ‘Did you know there’s a way to find out how many one star reviews you’ve received from Uber drivers?’ Emma says. ‘Well, I’m gonna show you and I’m gonna ruin your day. Let’s go.’ All you have to do is go onto the Uber app and ‘Account’. From there, go to settings and then scroll down to find the ‘privacy’ button. Here, you’ll be able to navigate to the ‘Privacy Centre’ where you’ll instantly be asked whether you would ‘like to see a summary of how you use Uber’. Click through and scroll down to the ratings section. Et voila, you’ll be able to see how many times you’ve pissed off an Uber driver. Do you have a story to share?
