US President Joe Biden and several NBA legends have paid tribute to LeBron James after he became the league’s all-time leading scorer. The basketball legend, considered by some to be the greatest player of all time, reached the landmark in the Los Angeles Lakers’ 130-133 defeat to the Oklahoma City Thunder as he overtook Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James amassed 38 points in the narrow loss, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar’s tally of 38,387, which had stood for 39 years. Biden lauded James for his achievement as the US President said: ‘LeBron, congratulations. With your whole heart and soul you broke a hell of a record. ‘You elevated the game. More than that, like Kareem, Bill Russell and others who came before you, you challenged and inspired the nation to be better, do better and live up to our full promise.’ NBA legends have also sent messages to James with Los Angeles Lakers great Magic Johnson adding: ‘I never thought that Kareem’s scoring record would be broken by anybody. ‘It means more to myself and to our fans because you’re wearing that purple and gold and broke it as a Laker. This historic moment is so special because we will never see another LeBron James.’ Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry said: ‘Your sustained level of play for 20 years, reaching this pinnacle of scoring in basketball, it is unbelievable. ‘Way down the road, when we’re reflecting back on our careers, we’ll be able to be at that level knowing what it was like to battle at the highest level.’ Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant added: ‘It’s even funny to just even say that, you know coming from where you have come from, how hard you grinded for this long. ‘It’s been an inspiration since day one. Much love and keep setting the bar high.’ MORE : LeBron James reacts to breaking all-time NBA scoring record as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pays tribute MORE : ‘He’s an alien!’ – LeBron James gives his verdict on 7ft4in teenage phenom Victor Wembanyama
