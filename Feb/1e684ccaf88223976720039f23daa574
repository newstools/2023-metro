Love Island star Martin Akinola unfortunately left the villa without love, after Tanya Manhenga decided to run back to Shaq Muhammad after his brief Casa Amor tryst with her. However, it appears someone else caught his eye – none other than the show’s fabulous host Maya Jama, leaving fans dumbfounded after they witnessed him trying to ‘shoot his shot’ on live TV. On Sunday evening, 27-year-old Martin made his way to the Love Island: Aftersun studio to give Maya, 28 and the audience the lowdown on how he felt after becoming the latest islander to be dumped from the 2023 winter series. Maya questioned him about what it was like when he first arrived at the main villa with Tanya on his arm, as he remembered telling Tanya that he didn’t want to be a ‘test’ for her. ‘I said to her, “I’d like not to be a test, but I want to go into the main villa because you think we have a good connection.” She said, “Yeah we do have a good connection, blah blah blah,”’ he shared. Martin then admitted how distracted he ended up being by Maya with the presenter standing right in front of him, confessing: ‘So we go to the main villa. I’m there trying to like… you know… of course I’d got the beautiful Maya across from me.’ Maya’s head whipped around to face the audience in shock, as they whooped and cheered over Martin’s revelation. Being the professional that she is, Maya went back to Martin with another question to keep the conversation flowing. Nonetheless, fans at home were staggered by the senior software engineer seemingly hitting on Maya for everyone to see. ‘Martin really tried to drop game on Maya on live TV,’ one person tweeted, while another said: ‘Martin!!! Did you just shoot your shot at Maya Jama???🤭 I love this guy.’ ‘The look Maya just did to camera 🤣 not Martin tryna move to Maya,’ someone else remarked, while others expressed how continually entertained they’ve been by Martin over the past few days. During the recent Movie Night in the villa, before Martin’s elimination, he became the meme of the series as he sat at the boys’ table gobbling his popcorn as drama erupted between the other islanders. It was especially amusing for viewers considering Martin was watching arguments break out between Tanya and Shaq yet again after they’d reconciled. ‘Martin was like this is what I wanted to see CHAOS,’ one person tweeted at the time, while another said: ‘I’m crying Martin was really having the time of his life.’ Love Island returns tomorrow at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX.
