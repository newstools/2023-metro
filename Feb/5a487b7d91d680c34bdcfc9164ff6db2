It’s no secret that we all live for a bargain – but would 1 pence off an item sway you into buying it? Morrisons shoppers have named the supermarket ‘ridiculous’ after the price of a popular wine fell from £7 to £6.99. One customer in Consett, County Durham, said she thought she was in luck when she spotted a yellow price reduction tag under bottles of ‘The Best’ Pinot Grigio Rosé. Upon closer inspection, she realised the cost had been slashed by just one penny and opted for another tipple ‘out of principle’. Morrisons insists the seemingly pointless discount was a ‘system error’ and says bosses are working on it not happening again. One customer, who doesn’t wish to be named, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. I thought the sign meant I might grab a bargain but was stunned to see it was just 1p off. ‘I didn’t buy it out of principle. It seems ridiculous that they would go to all the trouble of getting the money-off signs printed and put up in stores but offer the customer a saving as little as that! ‘Even if it was 10p off a bottle it would be something but one pence is just an insult really. ‘Do they really think people will be lured into buying something to save just 1p? ‘I know times are hard for everyone at the moment and we all love a bargain but really, I don’t think 1p is going to make a massive difference to anyone at all.’ The wine is described as having raspberry and cherry flavours with a fragrant floral finish. A Morrisons spokesperson said: ‘This is a system error that generates the cross out and it’s a fix we’re trying to put into the system to avoid in future.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
