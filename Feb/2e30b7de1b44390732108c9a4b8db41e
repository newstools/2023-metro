A hapless robber used the sleeve of his jacket to look like he had a shotgun before making off with £130 from a betting shop. Kenneth Brown, 56, wrote his demands down in capital letters on a betting slip and passed it to the cashier at Coral in St Leonards, East Sussex. It said: ‘GIVE ME THE MONEY OR I’ll BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF.’ He jabbed his jacket-covered hand towards the perspex barrier, and shocked staff withdrew the cash from the register and handed it over. Brown tried to cover a CCTV camera on his way out of the shop on January 2, but he was soon identified by police and charged with robbery. Just two weeks earlier, Brown stole an elderly woman’s purse outside a Co-op supermarket in the seaside town. He was jailed for four years at Lewes Crown Court last week after pleading guilty to one count of robbery. Prevention Inspector Aidan Cornwall said: ‘This was a callous offence where Kenneth Brown sought to put cashiers in fear that he had a firearm in order to get them to hand over money. ‘He was quickly identified and arrested by our officers and we remanded him in custody to place him before the next available court. ‘We welcome this robust sentence of imprisonment to protect our community.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
