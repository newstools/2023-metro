David Beckham is apparently just as talented with his hands as with his feet, as he’s shown off his seriously impressive pancake-tossing skills. However, he did manage to miss one that landed on his chest and, of course, it was all caught on camera. The former footballer got busy in the kitchen on Tuesday evening aka Shrove Tuesday – or Pancake Day – with his two favourite ladies, wife Victoria Beckham and daughter Harper, on-hand to witness his flipping greatness. Making full use of the sprawling kitchen in their London home, David, 47, looked confident as he tossed his large pancake in the frying pan several times, even giving the camera a cheeky glance as he aced it every time. Victoria, 48, didn’t get involved in the action and was more than happy to film behind the lens, saying: ‘So it’s Pancake Day and David is tossing away. That’s impressive, he is so good at tossing.’ Clearly able to multitask, David then asked his spouse while continuing to toss: ‘Darling, what do you want on your pancake?’ David then held up a jar of syrup, prompting the former Spice Girl to joke cheekily: ‘I love me some sticky stuff. You’re such a tosser.’ However, the former Manchester United star tarnished his clean record in another video, where he accidentally flipped the pancake onto his chest instead, with Victoria seen in the background bursting into laughter while walking off. Still, he bragged in the caption: ‘Told you I Still got it @victoriabeckham ⚽️ 🥞 #Pancakeday 💛.’ Their youngest child Harper, 11, couldn’t resist taking on her dad in the flipping contest and did a pretty impressive job until she crumpled one in the pan. ‘What can I say… she gets it from me!’ Victoria laughed. It’s been a busy week in the Beckham household as their son Cruz has been celebrating his 18th birthday. Their third child headed to the pub with dad David and older brother Romeo, 20, where he sipped his first legal pint with pride. Got a story?
