A famous soap star has been arrested on suspicion of rape. The actor has not been publicly identified but is understood to be a household name. Aged in his 20s, the man was arrested after a woman, also in her 20s, came forward alleging she had been raped at a residential property in South London. The alleged incident took place on December 30 last year. Police are believed to have spoken to the woman and offered her specialist support amid the investigation. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson confirmed to Metro.co.uk that a man was arrested on suspicion of rape and has been bailed until April. They said in a statement: ‘Police are investigating after a woman in her 20s reported she was raped while at a residential address in the Southwark area on 30 December 2022. ‘Specially trained officers continue to offer support to the victim. A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of rape and has been bailed until a date in April. ‘Enquiries continue.’ The Sun reports that the actor’s co-stars on the soap have been stunned by the allegations and arrest. According to a source, the arrest caused ‘shockwaves’ through the cast. ‘This has sent shockwaves through the soap he works on. It has left people reeling,’ they said. ‘It’s a very serious allegation. ‘They apparently met earlier that night at a party.’ Detectives are currently investigating and will build a case for the Crown Prosecution Service should there be deemed enough evidence to go to court.
