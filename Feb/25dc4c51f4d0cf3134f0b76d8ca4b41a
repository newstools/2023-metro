Football fans are being warned about fake tickets being sold for the Carabao Cup final. Tickets for the match between Newcastle United and Manchester United at Wembley officially went on sale on Saturday. However counterfeits have already been sold on social media to Newcastle fans, the BBC reports. Northumbria Police confirmed many have ‘already fallen victim to scams’ – as they had paid upfront for tickets which they never received. Detective Inspector Phil Thoburn said: ‘Please do not pay strangers for tickets as it is highly likely to be a scam. ‘These people are despicable and are preying on those who are looking forward to enjoying the big game and trying every avenue to secure tickets.’ Police have also urged supporters to only purchase tickets from official sites. ‘If you are in any doubt, please walk away and report it,’ Thoburn said. During their last Wembley final attempt in 1999, Newcastle were beaten by Manchester United in the FA cup. If they win the pivotal match on February 26, it will be their first major trophy since the Inter Cities’ Fairs Cup in 1969. Anyone who believes they have been sold fake tickets can contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or report it online. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
