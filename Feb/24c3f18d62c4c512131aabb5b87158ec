Laura Anderson appears to have erased any mention of her ex Gary Lucy in her pregnancy announcement post she shared last week. The surprise announcement came after rumours the 33-year-old Love Island star and the Footballer’s Wives and Hollyoaks actor, 41, had split in January when the former posted some cryptic Instagram stories. But the announcement suggested otherwise, as the pair posed for various photos and videos looking over the moon alongside the scan reveal. In one snap Gary holds up a little baby grow sporting the words: ‘The one where we become parents.’ Originally, the pair captioned the post with: ‘Our hearts are full, Baby Lucy due Summer ‘23.’ But now it has been confirmed they have actually split, Laura has edited the post so it doesn’t mention Gary at all and it now reads instead: ‘My heart is full 🫶🏼 Baby Anderson due Summer ‘23’. Not long after the pregnancy announcement the news came that the couple was no longer together, as Gary revealed: ‘I love Laura but we are no longer together’. Speaking to The Sun, he continued: ‘My main drive as always is to work together to co-parent our child. I look forward to the arrival of the new baby.’ The Bill actor, who also shares four children with his ex-wife Natasha Gray, later revealed they parted ways after he refused to move to the Love Islander’s native Scotland because of his commitments to his kids in England. Gary said: ‘Laura did want me to move but I have my responsibilities here. ‘I have four kids and all the things that go along with that so it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to uproot at this time.’ He continued: ‘Having gone through a divorce, my children need me and living such a long way from them just would not be possible ‘I wish I could break myself in half. I would if I could.’ Laura has been far more tight-lipped about the situation, aside from when breakup rumours were sparked in January after the reality star posted some cryptic messages, one of which read: ‘I deserve it all. The career. The love. The family. The peace. The life.’ She added: ‘We all do my angels. Especially the peace.’ This came after Laura cared for Gary when he endured a horrific car accident on Boxing Day. The pair first went public with their romance last summer after they both starred in last season’s Celebs Go Dating, so it’s been a bit of a whirlwind. Got a story?
