Chelsea manager Graham Potter has described Jorginho’s move to Arsenal as  ‘win, win, win’ for everyone involved. Arsenal were desperate to sign a new central midfielder in the January transfer window and after failing with multiple offers for Brighton’s Moises Caicedo, Jorginho ended up joining the Premier League leaders in a £12m deal from Chelsea on deadline day. Jorginho’s contract with Chelsea was due to expire at the end of the season, while Potter’s squad was also bolstered on deadline day as the club secured a €121m (£107m) deal with Benfica for Enzo Fernandez. The Italy international, who has won the Champions League and Europa League during his time at Stamford Bridge, has been a regular during Potter’s reign at the club and the Chelsea manager insists Arsenal have signed a ‘top professional’. When asked about Jorginho’s exit, Potter said at his press conference on Thursday: ‘Firstly, for the four months I’ve worked with him he’s been fantastic, great person. ‘I think when you look at his service to this club it’s been brilliant, what he’s achieved. ‘I think sometimes you look and have to make a decision as a football club with the contract situation he had, and the opportunity he had to secure something a little bit more for his family. ‘It was one of those situations which was a bit of a win, win, win. ‘From my perspective I wish him well, he’s a top professional and a top person.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
