Chelsea outcast Hakim Ziyech has been left ‘upset’ after his deadline-day move to Paris Saint-Germain fell through. The Morocco winger was keen to leave Stamford Bridge during the January transfer window after only starting four Premier League games this season. Ziyech was held in high regard when he completed a £33m move from Ajax in 2020 but he has flattered to deceive in west London and wanted to revive his career elsewhere. The 29-year-old agreed personal terms with PSG over a loan move to the French capital but the deal broke down in dramatic fashion. Both parties expected to finalise an agreement but the documentation to complete the transfer was not submitted in time. Ziyech was in Paris on transfer deadline day preparing to be unveiled as a PSG player, but will now return to London and finish the season at Chelsea. PSG are privately blaming Chelsea for not submitting documents to the French authorities before the deadline and the failed transfer has left Ziyech ‘upset’, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ziyech was linked with a number of clubs in January, with Everton, Newcastle United and Roma considering moves for the Chelsea outcast. Blues boss Graham Potter now faces the tough task of reintegrating Ziyech into his first-team squad, with Chelsea returning to action on Friday against London rivals Fulham. While Ziyech will remain at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea sanctioned Jorginho’s move to Arsenal on transfer deadline day before completing a British record deal for Enzo Fernandez. The likes of Mykhailo Mudryk, David Datro Fofana, Noni Madueke and Joao Felix all also arrived in west London in January.
