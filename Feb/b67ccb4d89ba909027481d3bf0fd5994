When you step into a Lush store this week, you could be doing more than picking up some great-smelling goodies The cosmetic chain has launched a campaign to call on MPs to ban conversion therapy – with no exemptions. The UN defines conversion therapy as an umbrella term to describe ‘interventions of a wide-ranging nature, all of which have in common the belief that a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity can and should be changed.’ Conversion therapy methods vary widely, with some of the so-called therapies involving psychotherapy or medical practices. People who have been subjected to conversion therapy have also reported being electrocuted. Lush’s campaign, in partnership with Galop, the LGBT+ anti abuse charity, invites shoppers to come into store, where they can scan a QR code to send a Valentine’s e-card to their MP, asking them to have a heart, and ban this horrific practice. Customers can also sign a large Valentine’s Day card in stores, which will later be sent to MPs. During  the campaign, which runs until tomorrow, you can also buy an adorable limited edition heart-shaped ‘washcard’, with the words ‘proud to love you’ written across it. All of the proceeds from the sales of the £3.00 washcard (minus VAT) will be donated to Galop who offer support services for LGBT+ people experiencing so-called ‘conversion therapy’ and other forms of abuse. And as an added bonus, the washcard – a sort of perfume bar that can be washed into the skin – smells great. According to Lush, ‘grapefruit oil layers on bitter citrus, and prominent petitgrain produces a woody green aroma.’ Do you have a story to share?
