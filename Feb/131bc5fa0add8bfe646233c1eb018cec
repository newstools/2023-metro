If you’re a condiment connoisseur, your fridge is about to get even more exciting. Heinz has unveiled three new products, combining its classic mayonnaise with sriracha, mustard and BBQ sauce. The new ‘mayo mashups’ have come about after discovering that 51% of Brits mix sauces on their plates and all three are available in ASDA stores from today, February 13, for £3.39. In terms of the flavours themselves, MayoRacha – AKA, mayonnaise and sriracha – is spicy, sweet and tangy. The brand suggests pairing it with pizza crusts or drizzling on sushi for delicious results. Whereas traditionalists might prefer MayoMust (mayonnaise and mustard) to elevate hot dogs and burgers, without the need to combine separate sauces beforehand. Likewise, MayoCue (mayonnaise and BBQ sauce) is great with meat dishes, burgers and pizzas. These three new sauces have the nation’s seal of approval, too. Following the success of its ketchup and mayo mashup – Heinz Saucy Sauce – in 2019, Heinz asked Brits to vote for which ‘mashups’ they wanted to see the next and these flavours topped the rankings. Wendy Lin, the senior brand manager at Heinz, said: ‘We love that people are getting creative with their sauce combos. So, we placed the power in the hands of the public to decide what Mashup we should create next. ‘A quick dollop of our MayoRacha, MayoMust or MayoCue is all it takes to level-up mealtimes and get your tastebuds tingling. ‘Our Mashupz are the perfect companion for pizza crusts, chips, burgers, sandwiches, sushi lunches and so much more.’ Do you have a story to share?
