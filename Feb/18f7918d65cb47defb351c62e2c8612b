Gemma Arterton has revealed she gave birth to her first child last year, having kept the announcement a secret until now. The actress, 36, confirmed her pregnancy in November, debuting her baby bump at Raindance Film Festival. And she’s now shared that she gave birth to a baby boy. Speaking to Zoe Ball on Radio 2, Gemma said: ‘We are very very happy, he was born just before Christmas. A little Christmas elf.’ Arriving at the studios, Gemma looked incredible in a pink satin dress with a matching coat and heels, and when Zoe gushed over her look, the new mum simply replied: ‘It’s the power of the paintbrush’. The Quantum of Solace and St Trinian’s star has been married to Irish actor Rory Keenan since 2019. The actress, who rarely shares details about her private life, had spoken about her future plans to have children in 2013, telling The Times: ‘I don’t think you can ever plan the right, exact time. ‘I don’t feel ready for kids because I want to know that I can come back and still be valuable to the industry. ‘That’s only going to happen when I feel a little bit more accomplished… or at least when I’ve accomplished something of which I’m proud.’ Later, in 2018, she admitted that she will be a ‘worrier’ when she does become a mother, telling the Telegraph: ‘I’m a neurotic person and a worrier anyway, and I think, “Oh God, when I have kids am I still going to be able to do all this?” ‘When we were kids my mum and my grandmother didn’t work, and I think that made them sad. That has influenced me.’ Got a story?
