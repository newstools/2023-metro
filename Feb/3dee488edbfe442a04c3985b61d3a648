An anti-monarchy protester was led away by police as the Prince and Princess of Wales greeted crowds of fans in Cornwall. The man appeared to hold up a blank piece of paper during the royal couple’s visit to Falmouth this afternoon. Footage of the incident shows someone being bundled off by officers. He was detained but not arrested. He apparently later told reporters on the scene: ’It’s the 21st century and we don’t need a monarchy any more.’ The demonstrator was free to go after Prince William and Kate had left the spot. Devon and Cornwall Police told Metro.co.uk a vocal male was ‘spoken to and left the area’. A spokesperson added: ‘There have been no arrests, nor any follow-up policing matters linked to this minor incident.’ Kate and William spent the early afternoon learning about Cornwall’s maritime heritage at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall (NMMC) on the town’s Discovery Quay. After visiting the museum’s workshop, they met young people and watched pupils from a local school taking part in a model boat race. A sweet moment emerged at the NMMC when Kate recognised one of its volunteers as her former history teacher, Jim Embury, and went to hug him. After clocking who he was instantly, she told him: ‘The things you taught me, I now teach to my children.’ Jim, who taught the Duchess of Cornwall at her prep school around 25 years ago, said he was thrilled to bump into his former pupil. He added: ‘She was a fantastic student and it was a great class.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
