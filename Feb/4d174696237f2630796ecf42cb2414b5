A man who was barred from every McDonald’s toilets in the UK when he was caught upskirting has been jailed for breaching his court order. Asere Shumba, 27, was handed the ban after he was found filming in the women’s bathrooms at a McDonald’s in Surrey and a Walkabout bar in Derby. Almost 400 upskirt-style photos were also found in his possession, and he was convicted on two counts of voyeurism in January 2021. An image of Shumba was distributed to workers at the fast food chain so they would recognise him if he tried to visit their toilets. A court heard he was spotted by a member of staff going into the women’s cubicles at a Derby branch of McDonald’s at 6pm on December 28 last year. The worker followed him in to the toilet and told him to leave before officers were called. Although he tried to protest his innocence by telling staff he thought it was the men’s lavatories, Shumba was arrested at his home address in Derby later that evening. He was charged with breaching his Sexual Harm Prevention Order. After admitting the offence at Derby Crown Court, he was jailed for 20 weeks on Tuesday. Recorder William Harbage KC previously told him: ‘The offence of voyeurism is serious as it invades people’s privacy and dignity.’ The judge added it was not clear what drove him to commit the offences but that he clearly ‘got sexual gratification from it.’ Upskirting, which involves taking pictures or videos up somebody’s clothing to see their genitals or underwear, became a criminal offence in England and Wales four years ago following a high-profile campaign by victims.
