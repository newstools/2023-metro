A 53-year-old man who had been arrested in connection with the disappearance of an 11-year-old girl from Scotland has been charged by police. Police Scotland said the girl was reported missing from the Borders on Sunday night, before being found at a property in Galashiels at around 9.30pm the following day. Mountain rescue teams had joined search efforts after sightings near the town’s Interchange – which offers train and bus services from the town. Door-to-door inquiries were carried out in the area. The man is expected to appear at Selkirk Sheriff Court on Thursday. Large groups of volunteers had joined the search efforts and various areas were cordoned off by police. Chief Superintendent Catriona Paton, Lothians and Scottish Borders commander, said: ‘I want to thank the public for their huge effort and assistance during this incident. ‘The people of Galashiels really came together and supported each other, the emergency services and search teams. ‘We believe this incident to be contained and enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing. ‘There will be increased high visibility patrols in the streets to provide reassurance and advice to the public, and anyone with concerns can speak to an officer at any time.’ Galashiels has a population of around 12,600 and is 35 miles south of Edinburgh.
