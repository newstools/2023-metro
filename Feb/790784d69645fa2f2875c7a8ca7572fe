Police launched a manhunt after a man attempted to pick up a young girl in a park. It was reported the child was playing in Nuttal Park in Ramsbottom on Sunday at around 3pm when the incident happened. The stranger approached the five-year-old and attempted to pick her up. But her parents spotted what was happening and went over to him, so he ran away into the nearby woodland area. The schoolgirl was left unharmed and an investigation is now taking place. Detectives wish to speak to a man who is described as tall, white and wearing black gloves, a red bobble hat, a black jacket and had a backpack on. St Andrew’s CE Primary School in Ramsbottom, where the girl attends, sent a warning to parents yesterday. Headteacher Damian Marsh wrote: ‘An incident happened in Nuttall Park, Ramsbottom, yesterday (around 3pm) where a man attempted to grab one of the pupils from our Reception class. ‘Mum managed to pull the child from him and the man ran away into the woods.
