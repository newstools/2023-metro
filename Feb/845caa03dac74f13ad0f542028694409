The brother of murdered two-year-old James Bulger has said he will never forgive his killers three decades later. Speaking ahead of the 30th anniversary of the tragedy today, Michael Fergus called for murderer Jon Venables, along with his accomplice Robert Thompson, to remain behind bars. James was tortured and killed by the 10-year-olds after they snatched him from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, on February 12, 1993. Mr Fergus was born eight months later, and though he never got to meet his brother, he has grown up with the effects of the tragedy. Now a 29-year-old landscape gardener living in north-west England, Mr Fergus told the Sunday Express: ‘My brother’s killers will never be forgiven. ‘They took away my older brother who I never got to meet. I would have loved to have looked up to him, asked him questions, talked to him about exams, cars, going to bars, normal stuff. ‘But because of those two I never got the chance. They robbed me of my childhood, in a nutshell.’ He added that ‘justice for James’ meant ‘keeping Venables behind bars’ to provide ‘peace of mind’ for the family, particularly their mother. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, who is also deputy prime minister, will ‘do everything in his power’ to keep dangerous offenders in jail. A spokesperson said: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister will do everything in his power to keep dangerous offenders behind bars and has set out plans to overhaul the parole process and put victims at the heart of the process.’ Thompson and Venables were jailed for life but released on licence with new identities in 2001. Venables, 40, was sent back to prison in 2010 and 2017 for possessing indecent images of children. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
