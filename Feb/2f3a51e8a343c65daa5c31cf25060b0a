Former Love Island star Amber Gill has appeared to go public with her girlfriend Jen Beattie on Valentine’s Day as the couple celebrated the occasion with a spa day. The 2019 Love Island winner, 25, has been linked to the Arsenal star, 31, for a few months after the pair were spotted on a Winter Wonderland date in December. While Amber had previously confirmed she was dating someone, she had been quite coy about who her new love interest was. Then, on Tuesday, both Amber and Jen shared photos of a bunch of flowers, while Amber shared a photo inside ESPA Life at Corinthia in London, tagging the football player. She also later shared a selfie and captioned it: ‘National take your gf to spa day.’ Last month Amber was seen leaving Borehamwood Football Club with Jen after a match. The reality star and beauty therapist strolled out of the club alongside Jen, who has just helped secure a win over Leeds United Women’s team, having beaten them by nine goals to zero. Speaking about her love life in a recent interview, Amber said she wanted to keep her relationship private for a little while longer. ‘I’m not ready to tell just yet,’ she admitted. ‘You know when you just want to keep things to yourself to see how it goes until like, it’s real life?’ She added: ‘It’s like when you’re dating someone, you don’t tell your mum straight away, like that, just taking it slow.’ Amber won Love Island with rugby union player Greg O’Shea, beating the bookies’ favourites Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague in the final.
