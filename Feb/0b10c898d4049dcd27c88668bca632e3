Three teenagers, all aged 19, were injured when a gunfight broke out near a park in Birmingham. Shots were fired on Hamstead Road, near the entrance to Handsworth Park, after 6pm on Friday, prompting a huge police response. Armed officers flooded the scene, next to Welford Primary School, cordoning off the road. Paramedics treated one of the boys for a gunshot wound to his leg before taking him to a nearby hospital. The other two male victims were also taken to hospital later, with non-life treating injuries. One suffered an injury to his foot and the second to his chest. West Midlands Police have launched an investigation into the horror incident, and a cordon is still in place today. An 18-year-old man arrested nearby last night on suspicion of possessing a knife, remains in police custody. Detective inspector Matt Underwood said: ‘We understand incidents of this nature are shocking and we are thoroughly investigating all lines of enquiry. ‘We have already spoken with a number of people who were at the scene but we would also urge anyone who can help further with our enquiries to get in touch.’ Investigators have been speaking with witnesses and are reviewing CCTV footage from the area. Officers from local teams are also carrying out extra patrols to support the community.
