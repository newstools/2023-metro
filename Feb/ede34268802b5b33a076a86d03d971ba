It’s finally happening! Rihanna is actually returning to the stage in a matter of hours for the Super Bowl Halftime show. The 34-year-old pop star, whose most recent album Anti dropped a whopping seven years ago, is set for her live comeback during the Big Game as she ticks off another huge career milestone. She’ll be delivering a 13-minute set highlighting her incredible run, with fans hoping to see her delve into all eras from 2005’s debut single Pon de Replay to material from 2016’s Anti. Although RiRi has been staying tight lipped about what exactly fans should expect from the set – there are ’39 versions’ of the set list floating around – she has revealed she wants the show to be a ‘celebration’ of her work so far. She teased: ‘At the end of the day, if it flops or it flies, my name has to stand by that. So, I really get involved with every aspect of anything that I do.’ Rihanna doesn’t do things by halves – so with the Super Bowl upon us, let’s take a look back and her (many) career highlights.
