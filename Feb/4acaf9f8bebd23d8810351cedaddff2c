Following the launch of Reactions last year, Whatsapp is rolling out ‘the number one feature’ requested by users with ‘Status Reactions’. You can now quickly reply to any status by swiping up and tapping on one of eight emojis. This is in addition to the ability to reply to a status with a text, voice message or stickers. ‘We’re adding status reactions to provide a quick and easy way to respond to status updates from your friends and close contacts,’ said Whatsapp in a blog post. The update is part of a bundle of new updates being introduced to Whatsapp status. Now, users can control who can view their status with the ‘Audience Selector’ feature. ‘We’re providing you with the flexibility to update your privacy settings so you can choose who views your status each time you update it. Your most recent audience selection will be saved and used as the default for your next status. Whatsapp is also introducing the ability to record and share voice messages up to 30 seconds on WhatsApp status. Other new features include status profile rings and link previews for more visual status updates. These updates have started rolling out to users globally and will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.
