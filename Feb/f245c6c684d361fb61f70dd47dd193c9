At least 2,500 people have died as a result of devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria today. The impact of the disasters on the countries’ physical landscapes has been laid bare in a series of pictures. Vital infrastructure, people’s homes and landmarks with huge cultural significance were all destroyed in a matter of minutes by the initial 7.8-magnitude quake. Even further damage has been inflicted by a series of strong aftershocks, with officials saying the number of buildings levelled by the shaking is in the thousands. A castle that has stood at the centre of Gaziantep, Turkey’s sixth-largest city, for around 18 centuries was largely turned into a ruin. Meanwhile a mosque in Malatya, which has been rebuilt three times after being hit by three different earthquakes over 180 years, was again reduced to rubble. While Turkey and Syria were worst-hit, the earthquakes could be felt as far south as Egypt. Before and after pictures demonstrate the shocking extent of the loss across Turkey – and the work that lies ahead, in order to rebuild.
