A woman has been arrested on suspicion of trying to murder three young kids and another woman who were found with suspected stab wounds. The four victims were found with serious injuries caused by a ‘bladed weapon’ at a proprety in Huddersfield around 8am on Monday, police said. They were rushed to hospital where they were still being treated early on Monday afternoon. The two children included two boys and a girl but no other details were initially available. Officers were called in by the ambulance service who were concerned paramedics could not attend the scene safely alone. DCI Sam Freeman said: ‘Enquiries are ongoing today into what has clearly been a serious and distressing incident in Huddersfield and we fully appreciate the concern it will cause in the local community. ‘Detectives are conducting enquiries to determine the exact circumstances of what has taken place and an arrest has now been made as part of those investigations.’ Officers remained at the property on Monday afternoon and ‘reassurance patrols’ were due to continue in the area throughout the day.
