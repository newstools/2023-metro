A serial sex attacker who prowled Tube stations to choose targets and attacked three women in eleven days has been jailed for nearly five years. Mohammad Yahia Alloush, 26, loitered at Dollis Hill station in north London for 20 minutes on September 5, before following a passenger out of an exit. He tailed her along several streets before violently attacking and sexually assaulting her. On September 11, he confronted a second woman leaving the same station, demanding cash and sexually assaulting her before running off. On September 16, he followed a woman from Neasden station and sexually assaulted her in an alley, before stealing her headphones and fleeing. His Oyster card and CCTV from his first attack were used to identify him and police arrested him on his way to work. At his home they found a T-shirt seen in the footage, and headphones stolen from his third victim. A DNA swab from the first victim was  linked to him. And mobile phone records put him near each attack as it happened. Victims told how they were now afraid to go out at night. One carries a whistle and a colour spray to mark any future attacker. Called a ‘cowardly, predatory offender’ by police, Alloush only admitted his guilt on the first day of his trial. He got four years and eleven months at Harrow crown court. He was also barred from being within 150ft of any London Tube, train or bus stop from 7pm to 7am until 2030. Det Con Matthew Chapman said: ‘His offending was apparently escalating, and areas of north-west London are safer for him being in prison.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
