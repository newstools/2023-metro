Anthony Joshua has confirmed he will return to the ring against Jermaine Franklin at the O2 Arena in London on 1 April. The former heavyweight champion fights for the first time since his second consecutive defeat to Oleksandr Usyk in August last year. Having linked up with another new trainer in Derrick James, he takes on American heavyweight Franklin who fought in the capital last November against Dillian Whyte. The fight will be the first of Joshua’s new five-year partnership with DAZN. ‘Mentally and physically I feel ready,’ Joshua said. ‘I want to put on a show and impress my coach as he has high standards. Franklin has a good style and a great attitude, which he has shown in recent fights. ‘This will be my first fight broadcast on DAZN in the UK and it will be globally available on the platform. ‘I want to thank DAZN for supporting both myself and the sport of boxing as a whole. I would also like to thank the team at 258 and Matchroom Boxing.’ Franklin was previously undefeated in 21 professional fights before losing a decision to Whyte last year. ‘The American gave Whyte a stern examination that night and was adamant he had done enough to get the win. ‘I’m ready to show the world why it’s time for me to take my place at the top of the heavyweight division,’ said Franklin. ‘Joshua had his time.  It’s my time to shock the world! This fight isn’t going to the judge’s card. ‘I will have win number 22 come April 1. That ain’t no April Fool’s joke.’ MORE : Anthony Joshua needs to start a new chapter with Derrick James but has a perfect comeback opponent in Jermaine Franklin MORE : Eddie Hearn reveals talks with former UFC champion Francis Ngannou and insists he should fight Anthony Joshua next For more stories like this, check our sport page.
