Maya Jama has addressed a small shoulder injury after worried fans noted a scratch and took to social media with their concerns. The Love Island host returned to the villa last night for an epic Casa Amor recoupling, which, as promised, brought us all the drama. But as always, Maya stole the show as she walked in in another killer dress. The 28-year-old sizzled in a red satin dress, with cut-outs across her neckline and chest, showing a small scratch on her left shoulder. Eagle-eyed viewers shared their concern, with one writing: ‘@MayaJama did you catch your shoulder with the hair straighteners!!’ ‘@MayaJama what happened to your shoulder?’ another asked. But Maya dispelled any rumours and addressed the injury, explaining: ‘I was shoulder dancing in a sparkly dress and it scratched at the Brits xx’. Love Island’s Casa Amor conclusion brought us all the drama on Thursday, with Olivia Hawkins’ slammed for double standards as she walked in with another boy but fumed at Kai Fagan for also recoupling. Meanwhile, Casey O’Gorman chose to stick with Claudia Fogarty, leaving Cynthia Osteh-Taiwo in tears. And all our hearts were left broken when Will Young admitted he hadn’t stayed loyal to Jessie Wynter. In the greatest betrayal of all, Shaq Muhammad was left devastated when Tanya Manhenga ditched him for Martin Akinola. But with all the drama and heartbreak end happily? Or are some romances over forever? Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
