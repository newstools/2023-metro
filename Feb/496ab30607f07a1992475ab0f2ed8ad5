A dad-of-two has vented his fury at McDonald’s after a pile of delivery orders meant he waited a whole eight minutes for two McFlurries and a milkshake. Imran Patel, 46, took his kids to the fast food chain at Shaw Cross near Dewsbury in West Yorkshire for a treat on Monday. But he was left tapping his foot and checking his watch as a line of delivery riders from companies like Deliveroo, Uber Eats and JustEat picked up food before him. He initially thought he’d been standing by for 15 minutes before his order was sorted – but a review of CCTV footage showed it was actually eight. In that period of time, he could have: Imran said: ‘I’d only gone in there for two McFlurrys and a milkshake, with it just being drinks it should only take five minutes for them to get it ready. ‘I wouldn’t have minded but it was completely empty in there too. ‘You look over to the area where they’re preparing the food for the delivery drivers and everyone is rushing around getting things out as quickly as possible. ‘I was just left standing at the counter wondering what was going on.’ He added: ‘It feels like if you actually go in to the restaurant you’re kind of ignored, like the delivery orders are more important.’ A spokesman for McDonald’s told the news site: ‘Customer satisfaction is a priority of ours and we place great emphasis on providing a fantastic experience to everyone who orders at McDonald’s, be it in-store, through the drive-thru or via our delivery partners. ‘In any instance that we don’t meet those high standards, we’d encourage customers to speak with the restaurant team to deal with their concerns immediately.’ On the opposite end of the McDonald’s surprise spectrum, last month a man found $5,000 in the bag he was handed at a drive-through. After handing back the cash, Josiah Vargas got get $200 and free McDonald’s for a month as a thank-you. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
