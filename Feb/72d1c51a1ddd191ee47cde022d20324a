Morrisons has put restrictions on discounted Easter eggs – but this hasn’t stopped people from buying more than their fair share. If you’re looking for cheap chocolate, Morrisons may be the place to go as the supermarket giant slashes £1.50 Easter Eggs to half price. The 75p deal on Easter eggs weighing between 96g and 128g is likely to help out customers struggling amid the cost of living crisis. But the company has banned people from buying more than 20 eggs each as bargain hunters flock to secure the deal. On the Morrisons website, it specifies: ‘Maximum 20 promotional items per customer.’ People have been left impressed by the deal, with Liam Till recently sharing a picture of the ten Easter eggs he’d bought for £7.50. Posting to the Extreme Couponing and Bargains Facebook group, he wrote: ‘Morrison’s 75p each don’t walk run [thumbs up emoji]’ Facebook user Christine Ball also shared a picture of her trolley loaded up with eleven Maltesers Easter eggs, six Aero Easter eggs, and three Cadbury’s Buttons eggs – all for £15. She wrote: ‘Been there, done that yesterday.’ One disappointed shopper wrote: ‘Blooming heck! I just paid £1.25 for one of those Freddo ones from Asda!’ The maximum-of-20 rule appears to be designed to make sure everyone gets a fair turn before the offer runs out on February 21. Yet, some people have ignored the limit and have been buying even more than 20 Easter eggs. Keighley Andrews admitted online: ‘I got 40 yesterday.’ Meanwhile, Lyn Knight said ‘if people want more you just go in twice and to different cashier or self service’. Another person commented: ‘I didn’t even leave my house I bought 34 online.’ Donna May added: ‘2 people go in from same family get 20 each …… or go in twice yourself as your [sic] a new customer every time.’ It comes after Easter Eggs first started appearing on shelves back on Boxing Day.
