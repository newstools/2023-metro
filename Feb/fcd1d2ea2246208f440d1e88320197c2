Cristiano Ronaldo has reached 500 career league goals as he scored all four in Al-Nassr’s 4-0 victory over Al-Wehda. The 37-year-old scored his first goal for the Saudi Pro League side last week but followed that up with a clinical display at the King Abdul Aziz Stadium on Thursday evening. Ronaldo reached his latest milestone by opening the scoring for Al-Nassr in the 21st minute with a neat low finish. The former Manchester United forward then doubled Al-Nassr’s lead with another firm strike five minutes before half time. Ronaldo completed the 61st hat-trick of his career from the penalty spot to put Al-Nassr even further in front in the 53rd minute. The Portugal international then capped an excellent display as he raced onto a through ball and scored the rebound after his first effort was saved. The 4-0 win puts Al-Nassr top of the Saudi Pro League on goal difference, although they also have a game in hand over second-placed Al-Shabab. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
