Gary Neville slammed Arsenal for ‘failing to show up’ as the Gunners relinquished top spot to Manchester City. Mikel Arteta’s side were beaten 3-1 by Pep Guardiola’s men at the Emirates, which helped City to regain top spot in the Premier League. Though Arsenal have a game in hand on City, the defeat means they’ve taken just eight points from 18 in the league. City took the lead after Kevin de Bruyne pounced on a mistake by Takehiro Tomiyasu but the Gunners responded well and found themselves level at the break when Bukayo Saka converted from the spot after Eddie Nketiah won a penalty. Arsenal entered the break with momentum and Guardiola was unhappy with how his side played in the opening 45 minutes. But the Gunners’ performance regressed after half-time and Neville, who has taken huge criticism from Arsenal supporters this term for his belief that City will win the title, criticised the side’s second half display. ‘So surprised how Arsenal have been second half!’ tweeted Neville.‘Looks too much for them! 20mins to show up!’ Arsenal face a trip to Aston Villa on Saturday, where they’ll come up against former boss Unai Emery. Arteta must pick his side up after the demoralising loss and Thomas Partey could return after missing the game against City with a thigh strain.
