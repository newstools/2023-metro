The stars are rallying around Bruce Willis amid his worsened health. The actor, 67, has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his family announced on Thursday. He was previously diagnosed with aphasia, a condition affecting his cognitive abilities, and announced his retirement. Then, in an update on social media, Willis’ family expressed their ‘deepest gratitude’ for the ‘outpouring of love’ they had received since the announcement. ‘In the spirit of that, we wanted to give you an update about our beloved husband, father and friend since we now have a deeper understanding of what he is experiencing,’ their statement said. ‘Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD). ‘Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.’ Now, those who admire the Die Hard actor are showing their support, with fans and famous faces rushing to offer the family their support in the comments below their announcement. Aaron Paul penned a supportive message below Rumer’s post, replying: ‘Love you so much my friend! ❤️ Sending hugs to you and that beautiful family of yours.’ ‘Your pops is such a damn legend,’ he added. Wilmer Valderrama wrote: ‘Sending you all my love.’ Amber Valletta added: ‘Holding you and your family in love and light.’ Australian actress Claire Holt penned: ‘Sending so much love ❤️’ Ireland Baldwin – daughter of Alec Baldwin – commented: ‘Sending you and your family all my love, always’. ‘God bless 🙏🏽💕’, added Snooki, while The Bachelor’s Nick Viall commented: ‘Sending you all my love.’ One Tree Hill star Sophia Bush commented: ‘Sending love to all of you 🙏🏼’, and Selma Blair added sweetly: ‘Sending love. 💛’ According to the NHS, frontotemporal dementia is an ‘uncommon’ form of the disease that causes the sufferer problems with behaviour and language. The star’s family explained that ‘today there are no treatments for the disease,’ which is something they ‘hope can change in the years ahead.’ They also shared in their statement: ‘As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research. ‘Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately. We know in our hearts that – if he could today – he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.’ Got a story?
