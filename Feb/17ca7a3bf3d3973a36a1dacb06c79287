Prince William and Kate Middleton have paid their first visit to the Bafta film awards in three years. The Prince of Wales, who has been the president of Bafta since 2010, followed stars such as Colin Farrell and Cate Blanchett on the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall. He and his wife had last attended in 2020, a ceremony held just under two months before the country went into the first Covid lockdown. Unlike Fantastic Beasts star Eddie Redmayne, William chose to wear a shirt under his tuxedo, while Kate wore a glamourous white Alexander McQueen gown with long gloves. She previously wore the same dress at the Baftas in 2019 – though there are some minor alterations, with the floral detailing on the shoulder swapped for a sweeping train of material. The last time she wore the dress, she paired it with earrings that once belonged to Diana, Princess of Wales. They have been replaced this time round with large golden floral earrings. Rather than physically attending last year, William recorded a special video message, in which he congratulated those nominated and praised the work of Bafta’s programmes. This is also his first ceremony since becoming the Prince of Wales the day after the Queen’s death in September last year – and his first as the heir to the throne. Several of the other stars were spotted wearing blue ribbons on their outfits, highlighting the plight of refugees and other displaced people around the world. Among the frontrunners for awards at this year’s ceremony are the Netflix film All Quiet on the Western Front, which gained the most nominations, and Martin McDonagh’s The Banshees of Inisherin. The show, presented by Richard E Grant and Alison Hammond, will kick off at 7pm. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
