We’re all for repurposing, but turning a grimy public bathroom into a quaint coffee shop appears to be a step too far for some. Attendant coffee shop in Fitzrovia occupies some old toilets built around 1890. Two years were spent restoring the restroom, with the original Doulton & Co porcelain urinals becoming a unique focal point. The original Victorian floor tiles are also still intact, as are the somewhat stained walls and porcelain. It has us equal parts intrigued and grossed out. Attendant is known for it’s coffee with multiple sites across London, although this was the first, and it also offers some great seasonal brunch options. Despite being a refurbed old public toilet, TikToker Lotteboo3 said: ‘Ironically, I didn’t see an actual usable toilet in this place.’ The secret spot was entertaining for some with one user commenting: ‘I can’t think of a worse place to bring you, let’s go!’ However, some weren’t overly thrilled with the idea of having coffee in a restored urinal. One unimpressed user commented: ‘With some of the original stains (decor)’ Another said: ‘It’s the stained walls for me.’ The general sentiment can be summed up by one comment saying: ‘I think I might give that one a miss.’ So if you’re looking for places to go in London that are, well, not toilets, then we’ve got some great spots here. But if the idea of having coffee in a restored toilet is appealing to you, we’ve found some other trendy venues which were once old restrooms. Do any of these tickle your fancy?
