Love Island star Laura Anderson is pregnant and expecting her first child with boyfriend Gary Lucy. The 33-year-old shared an adorable clip to Instagram sharing her pregnancy journey with the world, showing off her blossoming bump and early scans. Laura, who appeared on Love Island in 2018, met the Footballers Wives actor, 41, on Celebs Go Dating last year. The pair captioned the post: ‘Our hearts are full, Baby Lucy due Summer ‘23.’ In the clip, Laura posed in her underwear showing off the bump, while elsewhere the couple looked overcome with happiness at their pregnancy scans. In one picture, Gary posed with a baby grow in hand in a picture taken at Christmas, reading: ‘The one where we become parents. Baby Lucy due Autumn 2023.’ Another clip saw Laura sharing the three positive pregnancy tests she took early on, while elsewhere she adorably showed pictures of the scan to her dog. Fellow Love Island stars rushed to congratulate them in the comments, with Maura Higgins writing: ‘Congratulations,’ while Faye Winter penned: ‘Congratulations beautiful 🤍 so happy for you.’ Laura and Gary began dating after she split from boyfriend of five years Dane Bowers – with the former couple having openly spoken about their plans to settle down, with Laura also speaking about her difficulties with IVF. The happy news comes after Laura sparked split rumours from the Hollyoaks actor, who already has four children, two daughters and two sons with ex-wife Natasha Gray, with a cryptic post. The quote, posted to Laura’s story, read: ‘I deserve it all. The career. The love. The family. The peace. The life.’ She added: ‘We all do my angels. Especially the peace,’ alongside an emoji of a blonde woman meditating. She also shared a number of cryptic stories, including one of her cuddled up to her pet dog. She wrote: ‘I know I’ve been a little bit quiet on here and not myself this week or so. I’m going through a very difficult time, I actually don’t think I’ve ever felt so stressed in my life. ‘As we all know Instagram isn’t real life but oversharing negativity has never been something I like doing. ‘Anyway my thought of the day for us all is- Never lose yourself or your voice.’ Laura has recently been supporting Gary after he was involved in a horror car crash on Boxing Day. Following the crash, she thanked St. Joseph for protecting her boyfriend, posting an image of a laminated card of the religious figure. She wrote: ‘We’re not religious but thank you St. Joseph for saving my love. ‘Gary’s gran gave him this. It has words about safety and protection on the other side. I pulled it out his bag yesterday morning just before his accident.’ Got a story?
