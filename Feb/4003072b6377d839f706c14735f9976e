A headteacher at Epsom College and her daughter died in a ‘murder-suicide’ by her husband, it has been reported. The bodies of Emma Pattison, 45, her husband George, 39, and their seven-year-old daughter Lettie were all discovered at their home within the private school’s grounds in Surrey. It is now believed Mr Pattison killed the them before committing suicide shortly after, the BBC reported. Surrey Police have not yet disclosed the cause of deaths, but are expected to give an update on the disturbing case later today. The force had already confirmed this was an isolated incident and no third-party involvement was suspected. Their statement came amid reports that gunshots were heard before the three bodies were found. Police confirmed Mr Pattison had a shotgun licence, and they have been in touch with him about it last week. According to the report, Mrs Pattison made a distressed call to a family member some time late on Saturday evening. But by the time the relative arrived at their home, the three were already dead. Mrs Pattison became Epsom College’s first female head last September after six years leading staff at Croydon High School in south London. In a podcast released weeks earlier, she revealed how her small family had gone through ‘big changes’ since she started her new role. She said: ‘I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.’ Her husband was a chartered accountant who was director of a consultancy called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House.
