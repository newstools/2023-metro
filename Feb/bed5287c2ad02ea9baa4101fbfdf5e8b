Chelsea will look to sell Mason Mount this summer if he fails to agree a new contract, according to reports. The 24-year-old will enter the final year of his deal at the end of the season and the midfielder is yet to agree fresh terms with Chelsea. It’s understood that Mount is not willing to sign Chelsea’s current offer as the club want to tie him down to a seven-year deal. Chelsea currently risk losing Mount on a free transfer next year but according to The Athletic, the club’s hierarchy ‘will not countenance’ seeing the England international leave Stamford Bridge for nothing. Instead, Chelsea will be open to offers for Mount if his contract situation with the club is not resolved. The report claims that Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City are all interested in a move for the midfielder. Meanwhile, Graham Potter insists Mount has been ‘fantastic to work with’ during their time together at Stamford Bridge and hopes the midfielder’s future will be resolved soon. ‘I think it’s always complicated, there is always negotiation,’ Potter said last week. ‘It’s best I leave it between Mason and the club, that is the best way for that to be dealt with as far as I’m concerned, ‘He’s been fantastic to work with, an important player for us, and of course, I hope it gets resolved quickly.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
