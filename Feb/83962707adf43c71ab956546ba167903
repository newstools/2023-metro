Mikel Arteta has revealed that Thomas Partey remains an injury doubt for Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Aston Villa on Saturday. The Ghana international has been an integral part of Arsenal’s midfield this season but was absent for the 3-1 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday evening. Arsenal face a quick turnaround as they travel to Villa for Saturday’s early kick-off, but Arteta remains unsure whether Partey will be available for the game. When asked about Partey during his pre-match press conference on Friday, Arteta replied: ‘We have to assess him today again. ‘He had some discomfort, he had a little muscle discomfort. We have to assess him and see how he is. ‘Emile [Smith Rowe] will be training today, if he’s fine he’ll be in the squad and Gabi [Gabriel Jesus] is still not there.’ Jorginho was handed his first Premier League start for Arsenal for the defeat to City and Arteta has been impressed by how quickly the midfielder has made an impact since leaving Chelsea. ‘He’s really good,’ said Arteta. ‘He’s really come into the team and earned respect of everybody. ‘You see his leadership, his understanding of the game, how he’s coaching everybody. ‘I thought he had a really good game.’ When asked about the prospect of handing Leandro Trossard his first Premier League start since his £27 million move from Brighton last month, Arteta said: ‘He’s had an impact every time he’s been on the field, so he’s an option.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
