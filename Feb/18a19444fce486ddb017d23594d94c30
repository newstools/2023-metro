A corner shop owner has been fined after trying to flog a sausage nearly half a year past its use-by date. Local Mini Market in Bradford was also found stocking beef 35 days past expiry and garlic sauce 49 days out of date. Trading Standards said it posed a ‘significant risk’ to the public after making the shocking discovery during a routine inspection in October 2021. Former shopkeeper Karim Mohammed Omer Jaf, 36, was fined £207 and ordered to pay £640 in court costs after he pleaded guilty to a number of food hygiene offences. Prosecutor Harjit Ryatt said: ‘Use-by dates are very important, especially with products deemed to be highly perishable. ‘Products sold after that date are deemed to be potentially harmful to human health. ‘Legislation on this issue is very strict – any food for sale past its use-by date can lead to enforcement.’ Mo Hussain, defending, said it was common for people to debate whether out of date food was suitable to eat. He said: ‘We had a discussion in my house recently about how long after the use-by date was fine for us to eat a tin of beans. ‘The problem is that some products sold outside the use-by date can be more dangerous than others.’ Addressing Jaf, magistrate Alison Roberts said: ‘We understand this was a very difficult time for you, but at the end of the day the risk to the public by these products being out of date is significant, particularly the meat products. ‘One sausage was 155 days out of date – that is a very long period of time.’ The disgraced businessman, of Carrbottom Road, Bradford, was also dragged to court in July after Trading Standards found a £28,000 stash of counterfeit cigarettes at his store.
