A pair of smirking burglars are going to prison after inflicting a ‘huge amount of alarm and distress’ on a town. Terry Hannifin and Sean Ryan couldn’t hide their grins when police took their mugshots – but a judge soon wiped the smiles off their faces. The pair were arrested in November after being connected to a burglary and a stolen car and bike in Rugby, Warwickshire. Hannifin, 33, and Ryan, 31, both pleaded guilty to burglary, with the former also admitting a host of other offences, including theft, motor theft and driving while disqualified and uninsured. Ryan was also convicted of possession of an offensive weapon after police found a pair of nun chucks on him. They were both jailed for 33 months at Warwick Crown Court last Friday. Detective Constable Matt Rapkins said: ‘Hannifin is a prolific offender and his actions in November led to a huge amount of alarm and distress in the community. ‘A prison sentence will hopefully wipe the smiles of both their faces. ‘I hope this conviction reassures the community that we are committed to taking action to tackle offenders like Hannifin and Ryan who cause so much misery.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
