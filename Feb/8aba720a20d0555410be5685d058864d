Susanna Reid thought Harry Styles’ tattoos were part of his outfit. We kid you not. On Monday, the Good Morning Britain host was discussing Harry’s show-stopping looks at this year’s Grammys when she turned her attention to the hitmaker’s extensive collection of tattoos. Noting that the tinsel-inspired jumpsuit 29-year-old Harry wore to perform As It Was at the star-studded ceremony made him look like a ‘glittery yeti’, Susanna, 52, asked: ‘Has he got tattoos?’ Richard Arnold replied: ‘Yes he’s got tattoos on his chest,’ prompting Susanna to hilariously say: ‘They look like part of the outfit.’ Ben Shephard joined Susanna in the studio at the beginning of the week and also had thoughts on Harry’s jumpsuit, saying: ‘Look at that. It’s like he’s been sucked into a box of Christmas decorations.’ It was one hell of a night for Harry, who beat Beyoncé and Adele to win the coveted album of the year gong. As Grammys host Trevor Noah announced his name, Harry clutched his face and hugged Lizzo before giving a warm embrace to a very special superfan from Ontario, Canada 78-year-old grandmother Reina who got the chance to present him with the award on-stage. Pretty much summing up everyone’s reaction, the As It Was hitmaker’s first word when taking the stage was: ‘S**t.’ He then said in his acceptance speech: ‘Man, I’ve been so, so inspired by every artist in this category with me. A lot of different times in my life, I listened to everyone in this category when I’m alone. ‘I feel like on nights like tonight, there is no such thing as “best in music”. I don’t think any of us sit in the studio making decisions based on what’s gonna get us one of these.’ He added: ‘This is really really kind … this doesn’t happen to people like me very often, and this is so nice, thank you very much.’ MORE : Dave Chappelle wins Grammy for controversial Netflix special following transphobic backlash MORE : Who are Henry and Sam in The Last of Us episode 4 and are they in the video game?
