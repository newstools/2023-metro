Louise Thompson has shared a lengthy update following her recent health scare, admitting that she thought ‘she was going to die’ after her emergency ordeal, during which she ‘lost a lot of blood’. Earlier this week, it was revealed that the former Made In Chelsea star, 32, had been rushed to hospital after haemorrhaging at home. Her fiancé Ryan Libbey, 32, with whom she shares her one-year-old son Leo-Hunter, posted a statement on his Instagram Story that read; ‘Louise haemorrhaged at home, again. Rushed to hospital for surgery and close monitoring for four days. Louise is home now, stable and doing well. She’s a warrior!’ In a new post shared on Instagram, Louise expressed that ‘the last few days have been a rollercoaster’, writing: ‘From thinking I was going to die again, to being allowed home all in the space of a few days. What a whirlwind. Not sure I’m quite ready to digest it to be honest.’ The reality star stressed how rushed her trip to hospital had been, recalling the ‘adrenaline-fuelled phone call’ and the range of emotions she went through, from ‘laughter, to tears, to anger, to shouting, to apologising, to guilt’. Louise compared her most recent hospital experience to the last time she required medical attention, after which she felt ‘weak’ and ‘couldn’t hide the pain from anyone’, but she explained that this time around, her ‘brain is playing ball’. ‘It’s really strange, but I’ve been physically ok(ish) for months and months, and then BAM something really bad happened to my body again,’ she outlined. ‘I lost a lot a lot of blood. I think around 3L which sounds like over half my body’s supply…although I have to bear in mind i’m also really small. ’ ⁣ ⁣Louise recollected how she felt all of her limbs ‘go cold’ as her blood was trying to protect her ‘vital organs’. ‘From feeling all my limbs go cold as my blood tries to protect my vital organs, to shutting off my entire pain response as I had 4x canulas jabbed into my arms at the same time in Rhesus, wow, what a trip,’ she summarised. ⁣⁣⁣‘Thanks doctors + medicine and those dedicated to those improving medicine and science’y stuff for keeping me alive.⁣⁣⁣ And thanks to god and prayer for keeping me on this planet for another whirl. 🙏🏼🤍.’ The fitness enthusiast also express how ‘challenging’ it was to witness her son Leo’s response to her return home. ‘Something that WAS really challenging about coming home was seeing little Leo. Obviously this was the thing I was most excited about. I have to be careful with my body and rest rest rest, but all I want to do is scoop him up. We’ve developed this solid bond (to the point where he finds comfort in nuzzling in and resting on my chest and he’d rather be there than on other people and he gets teary when he has to leave, phew),’ she said. ‘And I think about him all the time, but since being away for a few days it’s like he doesn’t recognise me. I’m sure I have a tendency to exaggerate, but here I am NOT exaggerating.’ Louise said that her son ‘burst into uncontrollable tears’ when she came home, with her reaction making her ‘sob a lot and feel really confused’, after hearing that he’d been saying ‘mamma’ while she’d been in hospital. ‘I don’t know how people go away without their kids, the guilt I felt just being in hospital for a few days, which I accept wasn’t a choice, was unreal,’ she added. Louise shared a video of her, Ryan and Leo taking part in a ‘burning ritual’, burning things such as the T-shirt Ryan was wearing on the day of her recent hospital trip, as ‘the last time he wore it a bad thing happened’. She’s received a rush of support from friends and fans, with her brother Sam Thopmson’s girlfriend, former Love Island star Zara McDermott, writing: ‘You’ve done so well already. ❤️ Leo was saying mumamamama 🤍 onwards & upwards from here, every day is a new step and a new part of your journey. Remember.. nothing ever stays the same for long (my life motto !).’ Someone else commented: ‘You’ve come so far!! You are flying. Just remember not to let setbacks actually hinder healing, see them as fuel to your fire.’ Another person wrote: ‘You are amazing & one of the strongest women I know – be kind to yourself xx.’ Got a story?
