Perhaps quaint cottages and towering townhouses are not your vibe. If you’re looking for a slightly more unique listing, a property that’s just gone on the market in Fife, Scotland, might be up your street. The home, named Kirkholm, is actually a converted chapel that dates back to 1844. If that wasn’t enough it comes with its own heated swimming pool, too. Boasting a lot of curb appeal, the converted chapel was built as a Free Church by Lewis Mercer in a classic school style but has since been converted into a three-storey property. The four-bed home also comes with a kitchen, study, dining, sitting areas, a bathroom, generous garden and even its own sauna. Interesting internal features include exposed stone walls and cathedral ceiling in the reception room – as well as the broad central spiral staircase which leads up to the principal bedroom suite on the first floor. For those interested, it’s currently on the market for £435,000. The unique home is set on the edge of the local village, Seline, which offers a range of local amenities, including a primary school, church, convenience store and golf course. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Perth are also easily accessible from the village. Another quirky listing currently on the market is a cottage dubbed as ‘Britain’s flattest house’ – which is up for auction at £70,000. Likewise, a mansion that’s hosted four prime ministers is up for sale at £12million. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
