A woman bought a fish for dinner only to discover it was still alive after 48 hours on ice. Cindy Lao, of Cheltenham, had purchased the Crucian carp from a local fishmonger in Greenford while visiting friends in London for Chinese New Year on February 10. Arriving back home, she placed the fish in her freezer and thought nothing more of it until taking the carp out to prepare for supper. Cindy was then shocked to find that even after 48 hours on ice, the fish was still alive. Her partner, Paul Lewis-Borman, said: ‘[Cindy] called me down as she thought she had seen the Crucian carp’s gills moving and asked me what I thought. ‘They certainly were. ‘I was in two minds of whether to put the poor thing out of its misery but Cindy said, “no, it’s a miracle he is still alive.” So we got a bowl of water to put him in.’ The couple then acted swiftly and ran a bath to place the fish in, who they’ve since named Lazarus – after a figure from the Bible who rose from the dead. Paul added: ‘The carp was listless for a while, but after 20 minutes those gills were certainly going. ‘We had nowhere to keep him except the bath and luckily we have another shower room. ‘Needless to say he could not stay there and it did put you off when you were trying to use the toilet.’ Paul said the couple eventually decided to find a home for Lazarus. He posted on an online forum, and soon found a woman with a Koi carp pond who said she would take care of the fish. Paul added: ‘He needed to be rehoused, if for no other reason than my girlfriend was paying the fish more attention than she did me. ‘He had been through a lot. He was sandwiched between all those dead fish for all that time and was nearly dinner. ‘We are pleased he now has a good home. The lady told us he now has a best fish friend who he happily is swimming about with in his new home.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
