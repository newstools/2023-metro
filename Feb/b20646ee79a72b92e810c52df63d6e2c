Legendary football commentator John Motson has died aged 77. A statement from Motson’s family on Thursday morning read: ‘It is with great sadness we announce that John Motson OBE died peacefully in his sleep today.’ During his 50-year career with the BBC, Motson covered 10 World Cups, 10 European Championships and 29 FA Cup finals before retiring from the broadcaster in 2018. Motson had been a key part of Match of the Day since 1971 and commentated on almost 2,500 televised games. In 2001, he was awarded an OBE for services to sports broadcasting. In 2014, Motson was diagnosed with bowel cancer and was forced to miss covering the World Cup in Brazil. Speaking after his diagnosis was revealed, Motson said: ‘I consider myself very lucky I was diagnosed so early that the cancer was dealt with and the positiveness came about because I wanted to get back into my normal life. ‘That drive and determination was probably the most positive thing I could’ve had.’ Gary Lineker, who worked closely alongside Motson during their time together at the BBC, wrote on Twitter: ‘Deeply saddened to hear that John Motson has died. ‘A quite brilliant commentator and the voice of football in this country for generations. He’ll be very much missed. RIP Motty.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
