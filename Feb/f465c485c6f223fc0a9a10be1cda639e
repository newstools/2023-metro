The man killed by a falling hydraulic urinal in London’s West End last month was crushed after becoming trapped underneath it while carrying out repair works, an inquest has been told. Kevin Holding, 60, died at the scene in Cambridge Circus after the pop-up public toilet ‘dropped quite suddenly’ on January 27. An inquest into his death was opened and adjourned at Inner West London Coroner’s Court on Thursday. Police said CCTV footage captured the moment the urinal fell. The court heard Mr Holding, of Beckenham, southeast London, was a contractor employed by Hi-tech Washroom Solutions Limited, the BBC reports. He began work sometime between 10am and 10.30am and was almost finished working on the toilet when it dropped just before 1pm. The inquest was told emergency services were scrambled to the scene within minutes, but a vehicle to help lift the urinal was delayed and did not arrive for another two hours. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of Mr Holding’s death as compression asphyxia. He was identified by his Oyster Card. Senior Coroner Professor Fiona Wilcox offered her ‘very sincere condolences’ to his partner and three children, who attended the hearing.
