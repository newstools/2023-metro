An anti-Brexit protestor was tackled to the ground at a BBC studio after heckling Jacob Rees-Mogg. Protestor Steve Bray shouted ‘Tories out’ to the Conservative MP at a Radio 4 debate, prompting security to grab and escort him away from the evening. Mr Rees-Mogg responded: ‘Steve, it’s very nice of you to come and join us.’ He added: ‘Steve Bray stands outside the House of Commons every day shouting. ‘I’ve said to him many times, he should stand for election if he wants to get his arguments across. ‘He’s trying to disrupt us this evening. He is now being taken out so that we can carry on the discussion.’ Mishal Hussai hosted the event, which also included Labour’s Alastair Campbell and CBI chief Tony Danker. Britain left the EU three years ago yesterday. On leaving the Union, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ‘Boris Johnson was able to lead the world in getting a coalition against Russia to help the Ukraine and that happened because we were not bound in by the obligation of sincere cooperation within the European Union. ‘So we have done something to lead the west in a fundamentally important way that we could not have done had we been in the EU, we’ve saved £191bn and we’ve restored our democracy.’ However Mr Campbell accused Boris Johnson’s government of ‘telling lies’ during his campaign to get Britain to vote leave. He said: ‘We were told there was going to be a US trade deal. It’s nowhere in sight. ‘We were lied to repeatedly by Boris Johnson, by Nigel Farage and others, and I am not moving on from where we are and the damage this has done to our country until there has been accountability for the lies we were told and the crimes that were committed in the campaign.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
