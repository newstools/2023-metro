Protesters have spray-painted the Ukrainian flag on the road outside the Russian embassy in London. The protest was organised by the Led By Donkeys activist group ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion tomorrow. In a tweet, they said: ‘Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin’s imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination. ‘The existence of a massive Ukrainian flag outside his embassy in London will serve to remind him of that.’ The Met Police confirmed three men and one woman were arrested this morning on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway. Officers attended Kensington Palace Gardens around 8.45am, where paint had been thrown on the highway. The protest group were met with support for the stunt on Twitter, with one writing: ‘No idea how you arranged that, but I’m most impressed.’ Another said: ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you…’ Established in December 2018, Led By Donkeys is famously anti-Brexit, and routinely criticised former prime minister Boris Johnson as well as actions of his government. They’ve previously protested the former Metropolitan Police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, who resigned in February 2022. In a statement at the time, she said the London mayor Sadiq Khan ‘no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue.’ She added: ‘He has left me no choice but to step aside as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service.’ Dame Cressida was later replaced by Sir Mark Rowley.
