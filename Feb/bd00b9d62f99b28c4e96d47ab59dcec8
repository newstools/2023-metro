Chinese teenager Bai Yulu knocked in the highest ever break at the World Women’s Snooker Championship on Tuesday, making a superb 127 in a win over India’s Amee Kamani. The 19-year-old has been touted as one of the brightest young talents in the sport for a few years now, having won the World Women’s Under-21 title in 2019 at just 16 years old, beating future and current world champion Mink Nutcharut in the final. The pandemic hampered her progress, but she is now able to compete on the world stage and doesn’t seem to have missed a step as she impressed at the Hi-End Snooker Club in Bangkok on what was her first ever day on the full women’s snooker tour. The 127 breaks a record that has been in place for 20 years when Kelly Fisher made a 125 in 2003, a break that numerous world champions since then have not been able to match. Bai finished off the match with a fluent 64 to complete a 3-1 win over Kamani in impressive style. The teenager showed off her break-building in her Under-21 quarter-final against Thailand’s Natcharin Soraprasert, during which she made efforts of 63 and 86, setting up a semi-final with India’s Anupama Ramachandran. The Chinese star will prove difficult to stop in both events if she can keep up this kind of heavy scoring rarely seen in women’s events. The winner of the Women’s World Championship will not only lift the Mandy Fisher Trophy but book a place on the World Snooker Tour, winning a two-year tour card, starting next season. The champion will be crowned on Saturday 4 March.
