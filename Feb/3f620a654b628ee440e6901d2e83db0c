Love Island fans will have noticed that the boys’ pearl necklaces are as much a fixture of the Island as Ron’s need to ‘get to know’ every girl that walks in the villa. While there’s been speculation as to whether the male Islanders are sending some kind of hidden message with their jewellery, the most logical explanation is simply that the boys are bang on trend. Harry Styles is the main culprit when it comes to bringing pearl necklaces into the spotlight, and we’re here for it. The idea that fashion jewellery is for women only is old news – and we only need to take inspiration from Harry to see that. Known for wearing fashion pieces no matter what gender they were intended for, Harry shows us that fashion is for everyone. It’s fair to say that pearl jewellery for men is having a moment. Whether you want to go all out with a statement necklace or go in gently with a stud earring, we’ve got the options for you. These are our top picks. Do you have a story to share?
