Manchester City could face a points sanction after being charged by the Premier League by allegedly breaking a string of Financial Fair Play rules. The offences, which are alleged to have been committed from 2009 to 2018, are in breach of the Premier League’s rules on ‘fair’ spending. The investigation, which has taken four years, alleges that the club did not give a fair reflection of its revenue, sponsorship deals and operating costs.

Other charges include failing to cooperate with sustainability rules and UEFA’s own financial fair play rules. ‘In accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has today referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules by Manchester City Football Club (Club) to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4,’ a statement from the Premier League read. ‘Details of the Premier League Rules that the Club is alleged to have breached are as follows: ‘1.
