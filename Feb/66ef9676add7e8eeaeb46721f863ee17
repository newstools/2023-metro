Around 60 firefighters tackled a ‘very intense’ fire in a residential block in London tonight. The flames spread on the sixth floor of the building on Northumberland Park in Tottenham. Eight fire engines raced to the scene as upwards of 60 firefighters fought the blaze. Half of a five-roomed flat on the sixth floor of the building, Kenneth Robbins House, had become alight. Two people were able to escape the affected home and others in the building were evacuated. The fire was brought under control by 8.30pm. Station Commander Chris Kendall, who is at the scene, said earlier: ‘Firefighters are working in hot, challenging conditions to tackle a very intense fire. ‘The area is heavily congested and we’re urging people to avoid the area. ‘The blaze is producing smoke and we’re advising those in the vicinity to close their windows and doors.’ The cause of the fire is not known at this time. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus led a woman to safety via an internal staircase. She is being treated on scene for smoke inhalation. Olivia Opara, a reporter at the Haringey Community Press, had shared videos on Twitter and wrote: ‘Fire teams are on the scene and have evacuated residents from the building. ‘The fire broke out on the 6th floor, with spoke spreading the fifth.’ A 32-metre turntable ladder is being used at the scene of the fire as an observation tower. The London Fire Brigade was called at 6.20pm. Crews from Tottenham, Edmonton, Holloway and surrounding fire stations attended the scene.
