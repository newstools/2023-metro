The price of the cheapest items at supermarkets have risen by a staggering 21.6% in one year, leaving the poorest to bear the brunt of food inflation. A study by Which? found the rising cost of value items far exceeded the overall grocery inflation of 15.9% across all major supermarkets. This includes the average price of milk, which rose by 26.1%, and pork sausages going from 80p to £1.27 at Asda. Other big price increases include Sainsbury’s muesli rising from £1.20 to £2.25, and tins of sliced carrots up 63% from 20p to 33p at Tesco. The price of cheese went up by 23.8% overall, but some individual examples surged by as much as 96.6%. The findings suggest those who are likely to be already struggling to feed their families and pay their bills during the cost-of-living crisis are being hit disproportionately with the sharpest food increases. In comparison, branded goods rose by 13.2% over the year, own-label premium ranges were up 13.4% and standard own-brand items increased 18.9%. However, Which? found the discounters were generally still cheaper than their competitors. Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy, said: ‘It’s clear that food costs have soared in recent months, but our inflation tracker shows how households relying on supermarket value ranges are being hit the hardest. ‘Supermarkets need to act and Which? is calling for them to ensure everyone has easy access to basic, affordable food ranges at a store near them, particularly in areas where people are most in need. ‘Supermarkets must also do more to ensure transparent pricing enables people to easily work out which products offer the best value and target their promotions to support people who are really struggling.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
