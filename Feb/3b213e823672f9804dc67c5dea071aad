Salt Bae has embarked on a mission to provide food to 5,000 people affected by the powerful earthquake in Turkey last week. More than 35k people have died since the tremor struck Turkey on February 6, while a further 5.7k have been killed in Syria. Tens of thousands of buildings collapsed in the south of Turkey as well as northeastern Syria. Entire neighbourhoods were flattened in many towns nearer the epicentre of the 7.8-magnitude shock, which was followed hours later by an aftershock nearly as powerful. Salt Bae, real name Nusret Gökçe, hails from Turkey and took action this week in order to help those suffering in the aftermath of the natural disaster, with many left homeless and living in freezing conditions. The celeb chef, 39, shared an Instagram video of staff members preparing food inside his large food truck and long queues of people, including children, lining up to receive the free food. ‘We started serving hot food to more people, targeting 5000 people every day,’ he wrote in the post. In the clip, he said: ‘It will be the most important and meaningful service in the world for us.’ There was a lot of praise for Salt Bae in the comments section, with one fan writing: ‘Well done, so helpful in this time of need 👏 all the people who have nothing nice to say about this, when you are feeding 5000 + hot meals a day in the area and paying for it yourself then you can speak, until then shut up.’ Another supporter said: ‘People hate u will be hate whatever u do (even u make a good things ) , so keep do good things always dont care about all.’ One other weighed in: ‘All these people doing nothing but posting flags on insta are a bunch of haters. This is what we need to see more of humanity helping each other. I’m inspired!!!’ However, some accused Salt Bae of using the crisis as a promotional opportunity, with one arguing: ‘Was a great idea till it become wrong, evident that this was more about advertisement then actually helping. Filming the traumatised peoples faces from close unfair and out of order.’ One critic suggested: ‘How about taking your giant branding off the truck!!!!!’ Another said: ‘Well done but just stop filming and just get on with it. This ain’t advertisement ffs. These people have been and are going through enough. They don’t need people filming them during this horrible time.’ Salt Bae has come under fire in recent years, with his London restaurant Nusr-Et slammed for its expensive prices, and the chef himself criticised for gatecrashing Argentina’s celebrations on the pitch after winning the World Cup last year.
