Former X Factor star Rebecca Ferguson has given birth! The singer, 36, announced the surprise news on Friday (February 17) after welcoming her child earlier this week. She kept her pregnancy completely private, having not even confirmed that she was expecting. Her announcement was a total shock, as she shared a cute photo of her newborn’s tiny hand. She captioned her black and white snap: ‘Surprise! 👶 Turns out I can keep a secret.’ ‘Born on Valentines Day ❤️👶’, Rebecca confirmed. Rebecca was inundated with kind congratulatory messages, with one fan commenting: ‘Congratulations! Impossible to tell – amazing secret baby 😍🙌❤️’ ‘Yes finally you can say ❤️ & born on the day the world calls LOVE… What a blessing. Big love to you Jonny and your new addition ❤️’, another commented. The post was also liked by Cher Lloyd, who appeared on the ITV singing show alongside Rebecca in 2010. Rebecca’s baby is her first with husband Jonny Hughes, whom she married in December in a dreamy ceremony in London’s upmarket Mayfair district. The Liverpudlian musician is already a mum-of-three, having welcomed Lillie May and Karl during her romance with ex-Karl Dures, then a daughter named Arabella from a later relationship. Rebecca announced her engagement to now-husband Jonny last year on New Year’s Day, with the singer sharing a series of pictures and writing in the caption: ‘I am So ‘Happy’ to announce I am engaged to the love of my life ❤️ 💍👰🏾🤵🏻‍♂️,’ she wrote. ‘Dreams can come true ❤️.’ Following their idyllic wedding, Rebecca shared the importance of the venue. ‘Years ago when I was starting out, I’d get the Megabus from Liverpool to London. It was cheap as chips. We used to drive past Park Lane,’ she explained. ‘It was inspirational for me because I’d be looking at The Dorchester, thinking, “One day I’ll get to stay there.” It was a dream come true for me to get married there.’ Rebecca, who usually keeps her personal life quite private, also told Hello! magazine that she felt it was a testament to how far she has come to put the ‘horrible stuff’ behind her and find ‘peace and happiness’.
