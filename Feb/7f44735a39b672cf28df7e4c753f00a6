Loris Karius is in line to start for Newcastle United in their Carabao Cup final against Manchester United next Sunday. The 29-year-old, who spent two seasons at Liverpool, joined Newcastle on a free transfer last summer but is yet to make a senior appearance for the club. However, following Nick Pope’s red card against Liverpool on Saturday, Eddie Howe is without his first-choice goalkeeper for his side’s Carabao Cup final at Wembley. Martin Dubravka was brought on against Liverpool following Pope’s dismissal but Newcastle cannot play the 34-year-old in the Carabao Cup final as he has played two games in the competition during his loan spell at Manchester United earlier this season. That means Karius is set to play his first game in two years having made his last appearance for Union Berlin in February 2021. Newcastle’s alternative option to Karius would be to play Mark Gillespie against United. The 30-year-old joined Newcastle on a free transfer from Motherwell in July 2020 and has made just three appearances in the Carabao Cup during his time at St James’ Park. Karl Darlow, who is in his eighth season at Newcastle, left St James’ Park in January to join Hull City on loan for the remainder of the campaign. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
