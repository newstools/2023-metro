The US military has unveiled its latest drone – and it has reminded some of Thunderbird 2. The aircraft, from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson’s cult show, was known as International Rescue’s heavy-duty transporter aircraft. Its famous launch sequence saw it taxiing through a concealed hangar door disguised as a cliff face. It needed no real runway to fly over Tracy Island, such as is the case for US military’s latest drone aircraft. The unmanned XQ-58A Valkyrie blasts off from an inclined platform before taking flight. It was unveiled by the US military at their Elgin Air Force Base in Florida in December, with new images released this week. It was pictured taking to the sky and then flying in formation with a F-16C Viper fighter jet. The Air Force describe the Valkyrie as a low-maintenance, reusable vehicle designed to be used for several missions, but built at a cost that permits it to be a combat loss. They explain: ‘This long range aircraft is designed for high speeds and agile manoeuvrability, enabling it to perform a variety of missions. ‘It is runway-independent, offering maximum operational flexibility to the war fighter.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
