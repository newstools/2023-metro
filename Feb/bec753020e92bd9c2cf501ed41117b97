Meet Big Bertha, the two-year-old cat who was found matted and abandoned in a sports bag. Poor Bertha was found in Calthorpe Park in Birmingham by a member of the public back in October. She was extremely matted and overweight, weighing in at 11.5kg even after she had a trim to get rid of all the excess fur. She was so large that she couldn’t even groom herself. Named Big Bertha by her rescuers at the RSPCA, the kitty has already lost a third of her body weight with their help. Cattery supervisor Emma Finnimore said: ‘When she arrived she was 11.800kg. This is the largest cat I have seen in my 22 years working for the RSPCA. ‘A vet carefully clipped away her matting but she still weighed 11.500kg and was too large to live in a cat pod as she wouldn’t have been able to use the cat flap, so we had to adapt a cat run for her until she went to a foster home.’ Bertha was put on a strict diet and exercise regime when she was taken in by the charity. She needs weekly weigh-ins and regular vet checks to make sure she’s still on the right track. , Foster carer Emma Cureton, who is currently looking after Bertha in her home, said: ‘The weight has gradually come off and she’s already lost an amazing 3.82kg – which is a third of her body weight. ‘She’s still got a little way to go, but she’ll get there and will soon be ready to find a new home.’ ‘She was in such a sorry state when she arrived at the rescue centre with her matting pulling on her skin,’ Emma added. ‘We don’t know how she got so large as she is only a young cat. ‘We think maybe someone had been constantly feeding her as she was so large she was left unable to groom herself.’ Do you have a story to share?
