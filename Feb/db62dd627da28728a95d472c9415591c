Commuters were forced to leap from a burning train after it caught fire in Kent. The blaze, on a Southeastern train bound for London, took hold yesterday afternoon. People were forced to flee the carriage as it sent sparks across a nearby platform. The terrifying ordeal was captured on video and showed passengers running away as the flames grew. A series of loud bangs were heard before plumes of black smoke rose from the carriage. The train doors were hastily opened as the fire took hold at West Malling station around 4pm. A Southeastern spokesman said today: ‘A fire occurred underneath the 3.25pm London Victoria to Ashford International train yesterday evening. ‘On becoming aware of the fire the driver took immediate action, safely stopping the train at West Malling station so passengers could be immediately evacuated. ‘Emergency services attended the scene and put the fire out. ‘No injuries were reported but our team offered support to people involved, both customers and staff. ‘The safety of our passengers and staff remains our top priority and a full investigation will be carried out.’ Network Rail engineers attended the site to inspect the railway line and ensure it was safe to use.
