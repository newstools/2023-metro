Dermot O’Leary has revealed he’d rather try the male contraceptive pill than opt for a vasectomy. The 49-year-old joined Josie Gibson on This Morning as the pair discussed the new development, that can see men take birth control just before sex. The ‘on demand’ therapy blocks a fertility protein – for 24 hours, and has been said to be more effective than women’s oral birth control medications which have to be taken daily. ‘I cannot leave that sort of control in somebody else’s hands,’ Josie began, before saying Dermot had told her: ‘How do you think we’ve been feeling for years?’ The dad-of-one replied: ‘I don’t think I said that!’ ‘My point is that I’m not sure I would trust a man to remember to take it,’ he said. He clarified that this wasn’t about some ‘grand conspiracy’ about ‘men lying’, but continued: ‘I just don’t trust them to be organised to take it!’ Dermot shares his young son, born in June 2020, with wife Dee Koppang, who he married in 2012. When asked by guest Camilla Tominey if Dermot would prefer to take the pill over having a vasectomy, he replied: ‘Yes.’ ‘I think it’s a good thing,’ he added, agreeing that he’s ‘all for it’. ‘All joking apart, it’s good that men have to have some responsibility,’ Dermot concluded. This Morning airs weekdays from 10am on ITV. Got a story?
