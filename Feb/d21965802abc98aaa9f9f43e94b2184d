Love Island stars Tom Clare and Will Young are determined to win over Samie Elishi and Jessie Wynter after their Casa Amor antics were exposed. During Friday’s episode of the ITV2 competition, several of the original girls from the main villa met up with eliminated contestants who entered during Casa Amor to find out exactly what went down with the boys in their absence. Jessie, Claudia Fogarty and Samie sat down with Lydia Karakyriakou, Cynthia Otseh-Taiwo and Layla Al-Momani to uncover the truth, after Will confessed during the recoupling ceremony that he was unfaithful, kissing Layla behind Jessie’s back. While Tom took Lydia to the terrace and asked to kiss her outside of a challenge – the same line he once used on Sammie. Sunday’s teaser shows that Sammie and Jessie are still giving Tom and Will respectively, the cold shoulder and it looks like the lads are ready to get their grovel on. In today’s installment, Will, 23, tells Tom, also 23: ‘Mission get our girls back, we really need to think about this because we’ve got one shot, one chance and we can’t mess that up.’ Tom replies: ‘I’ve come up with something, I’ve never said a poem to a girl in my life but I want to write her a poem. ‘I was going to take her to the fire pit tonight, have a sit down and say that I’m sorry from the heart and tell her exactly how I’m genuinely feeling.’ Will their plans get the boys out of the dog house? Thursday night’s shocking episode saw certainly brought the drama from                 Casey O’Gorman recoupling with Claudia Fogarty and leaving Cynthia Otseh-Taiwo in tears, Olivia Hawkins taking aim at Kai Fagan, and Shaq Muhammad being blindsided after Tanya Manhenga ditched him for Martin Akinola. Overnight figures reportedly showed that the Winter Love Island Casa Amor episode attracted 1.3million, a far cry from the 3.0m that watched on during the 2022 summer series. In the years preceding that, 2.7m watched that season’s episode, 2.6m in 2020, 3.6m in 2019 and 3.8m in 2018. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
