Britney Spears has assured fans she is feeling fine after a number of reports this week that her husband and manager were planning an intervention. The Toxic singer, 41, was freed from her controversial conservatorship last year after 13 years, regaining control of her own life. In the year since gaining her freedom, Britney has duetted with Sir Elton John and married partner Sam Asghari, however also hit low points including becoming upset when she was filmed while out at a restaurant. Fans have at times been concerned for Britney’s well-being and mental health due in part to the eccentric posts she makes on social media, even calling police to her house when she deleted her Instagram. This week, Britney issued a furious statement after sources told TMZ and People that her inner circle, including her husband and manager, were planning an intervention that was scrapped last minute, with one source claiming they were concerned Britney had become so erratic she could ‘die’. Taking to Instagram on Friday, Brit raged: ‘It makes me sick to my stomach that it’s even legal for people to make up stories that I almost died … I mean at some point enough is enough !!!’ Now the star has again addressed the claims with a video to prove she is ‘alive and well.’ Everytime singer Britney shared a rare video of her speaking to the camera as she said: I didn’t die, people. I’m here. I’m alive. I am very much alive and well.’ She went on to show off a fur wrap she was wearing, grinning as she said she was ‘feeling myself,’ and added: ‘I am here. ‘I’m happy and I am well. And that’s it.’ She added in a caption alongside the clip: ‘This week in the news it said that I almost died and that I have a manager and “doctors” !!! ‘I don’t have a management team nor will I ever again in my life !!! I don’t have “medical doctors” !!!’I take Prozac for depression and that’s about it 🤷🏼‍♀️ !!!’ She added that she waas an ‘extremely boring person,’ saying she waas frustrated by the reports as it was ‘worse than a cruel joke because people actually believe this stuff.’ The 41-year-old went on to admit she feels like  ‘all of my efforts in getting better with my little routine of prayer and therapy seems to not count for anything when people can say things that are incredibly wrong !!!’ It comes after a source told TMZ that Britney’s husband, manager, team and doctors had planned to bring her to a rented houses for an intervention in an attempt to convince her she needed help. The source claimed the plan was for Britney to live in the rented house for up to two months while undergoing treatment, including counselling, but the intervention was scrapped last minute as she became ‘somewhat aware’ of what was going on. Her husband Sam told Access Hollywood ‘an intervention did not occur.’ ‘My wife is in full control of her life and will continue to make all decisions involving her care regardless of circumstances. Speculation on her health is inappropriate and should end immediately.’ Got a story?
