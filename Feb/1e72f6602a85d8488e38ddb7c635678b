Eminem’s daughter is set to walk down the aisle! Hailie Jade Mathers, 27, has announced her engagement to partner Evan McClintock, whom she started dating in 2016, and the married-couple-to-be couldn’t be happier. The influencer – who boasts three million Instagram followers – is one of three children of the Slim Shady rapper, 50. Eminem is also a dad to Alaina Marie, 29, and Stevie Laine, 20, whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Scott, 48. Sharing the exciting news that she’s soon to be a bride, Hailie shared the most adorable photos from the moment enterprise growth executive Evan got down on one knee. The first pic captured the brunette beauty popping a bottle of champagne to celebrate their engagement, while a second showed her shocked reaction when Evan pulled out the sing. A close up snap showed off the dazzler in all its glory, sitting pretty on Hailie’s finger and sparkling for all to admire. She captioned her Instagram post: ‘casual weekend recap… 😭💗 2.4.23 💍 i love you @evanmcclintock11’. Followers were overjoyed for the couple – and the comments section boasted its fair share of puns too. ‘Looks like his knees were week’, one quipped, in reference to her famous dad’s lyrics (genius, honestly). ‘Imagine having to ask Em to marry his daughter 😂🔥’, joked another. ‘Mathers and McClintock. So they’re… M&M 😂’, one follower laughed. Musicians and sisters Aly and AJ also wrote: ‘You’re all grown up – congrats Hailie! ❤️😍’ Hailie grew up in Detroit with dad Eminen – real name Marshall Bruce Mathers III – and mother Kim, who was married to the Lose Yourself rapper from 1999 until 2001, and again in 2006. The fashion and beauty social media star – who posts tutorials and chatty videos to TikTok – has spoken publicly before about her relationship with her famous father and growing up in the spotlight. Chatting candidly on an episode of her podcast, aptly named Just a Little Shady, last year, she opened up to questions from fans. ‘Does it bother me when I get asked about my dad? The best way to say this is yes and no,’ Hailie explained. She continued: ‘Honestly, it’s to a point. I obviously expect it. And there’s certain things I can understand why people are just genuinely curious about, as anyone would be when you’ve kind of grown up half in the spotlight.’ But, Hailie admitted that it does get to a certain point where she wants people to know ‘I’m a person, too.’ ‘So, it becomes tricky because I get it,’ she added. ‘But then, after a certain extent, I’m not going to speak on behalf of anyone. I’m not going to answer stuff that I don’t specifically have the answers to.’ Hailie also said she ‘didn’t totally understand the situation’ with her dad’s stardom growing up. Nowadays, though, she is more understanding of why people are curious, but she says people still do cross a line sometimes. ‘There are certain things that, yeah, that’s just weird that you want to know that. But then, things that have been a little bit shared, I understand why people are like, “Ok, is this true?”‘ ‘Some stuff it’s just like, that’s weird. Let’s move on,’ Hailie concluded. Got a story?
