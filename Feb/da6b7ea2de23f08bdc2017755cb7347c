Alexa Seary, whose surname is pronounced Siri, keeps activating Apple and Amazon’s virtual assistants when her clients say her name during online meetings. The 27-year-old has been the butt of jokes since Apple introduced its personal assistant function, Siri, in 2011. But she couldn’t believe it when Amazon released its own human-like bot, the Amazon Echo – and called it Alexa in 2014. Alexa, who lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said: ‘I like my name – it’s like a trademark. ‘But I’m constantly setting of people’s Alexa’s in their homes when they say my name in meetings. ‘I feel terrible when it’s a client call and they are all embarrassed.’ Working in a restaurant in her early 20s, Alexa was constantly faced with customers laughing at her name and giving her commands like a machine. She said when she’d introduce herself, they’d laugh and say ‘I have one of those’ and when they’d ask for things they would add ‘Alexa, get me this.’ Now working in social media marketing, Alexa says the jokes have died down and she now thinks her name is ‘cool’. She added: ‘I thought sharing my surname with Siri was cool as a kid. ‘When Alexa came out it went a little crazy and got a little annoying.’ Alexa says people are always quick to realise the connection with her first name but don’t always pick up the ‘Siri’ link until she says her name out loud. Alexa now uses her name as an icebreaker and sees it as a positive thing. She added: ‘It’s like my stage name. I think it’s cool and unique. ‘It gets pointed out on email all the time. ‘People always ask me if my parents knew when they named me but they can’t tell the future. ‘I think I’ll keep the name Seary in my surname when I get married.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.For more stories like this, check our news page.
