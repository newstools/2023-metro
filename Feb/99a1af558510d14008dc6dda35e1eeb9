Ligue 1 club Nice have made an official complaint to police after a porn film was shot at their stadium while the first team were playing a match. Nice won the game in question, beating Lille 1-0 on 29 January thanks to a Gaetan Laborde goal, but Laborde wasn’t the only person scoring. Fans of the French club let them know that the steamy video had been shot during the Sunday game after clips emerged on social media. Les Aiglons are far from impressed and have made a complaint to police, with legal action being considered. The company that operates the stadium, Nice Eco Stadium, have also filed a complaint as they don’t want to be associated with the smutty mid-match footage. The X-rated shenanigans did nothing to put Nice off their fine run of recent form as that victory over Lille was the first of four on the spin in Ligue 1, since downing Lens, Marseille and Ajaccio. Plenty of English fans will be following the fortunes of Nice in Ligue 1 as there are a number of connections with this side of the Channel. The club is owned by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, who is interested in buying Manchester United and is set to make a bid for the club he has supported since childhood. The French team also boasts the likes of England international Ross Barkley, Wales hero Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal loanee Nicolas Pepe, former Leicester captain Kasper Schmeichel and ex-Fulham defender Joe Bryan in manager Didier Digard’s squad.
