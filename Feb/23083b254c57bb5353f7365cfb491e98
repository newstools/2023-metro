Staff at an elementary school in Alabama were left gobsmacked after finding out a deer had smashed through one of the classroom windows and roamed around inside. CCTV from the Evergreen Elementary School captured the incredible moment the ‘unexpected intruder’ made its entry. The deer can then be seen slipping and stumbling around the empty room before heading back out the same way it came in. Sharing the extraordinary clip on Facebook, the school wrote: ‘It struggled a few minutes learning how to walk on our waxed floors. ‘Once acclimated with the new environment, it jumped out of the window as fast as it entered. ‘We were glad to see the deer not injured.’ The footage was filmed on February 11.
