A Royal Navy sailor has been found dead at a training base in Cornwall. The body of Leading Hand Benjamin Thomas, 24, was discovered at HMS Raleigh in Torpoint on January 30. His next of kin has been informed, a Royal Navy spokesperson said, but they would not confirm his cause of death. An inquest was opened and adjourned by the Cornwall Coroner on February 10. ‘The thoughts and sympathies of the Royal Navy go out to the family and friends,’ the Royal Navy said. ‘It would be inappropriate to comment, and any further inquiries should be directed to the Coroner.’ HMS Raleigh, where Mr Thomas was serving, is the largest Royal Navy training base in the South West, with some 2,200 people on site every day. Its 239-acre main site includes a maritime training centre on the River Lynher, and satellite bases for leadership and team-working exercises on Dartmoor and the Rame Peninsula. There are seven schools which provide training for the Royal Marines, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and the Royal Navy Reserve. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
