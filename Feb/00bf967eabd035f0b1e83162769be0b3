It may still be cold, but our minds are firmly set on spring – and when the seasons begin to change, so do our fashion choices. As weather starts to shift from rain to shine at the drop of a hat, dressing becomes trickier. After all, what do you wear in weather that is all at once cold and warm? Well, say hello to the transitional capsule wardrobe; a curated collection of easy to wear pieces that can be layered and paired with a plethora of other outfits. They are simple pieces in nature. Colours are muted, shapes are classic. It’s all about versatility and getting the most out of your clothes, along with comfort when the elements are being difficult. Must-haves in such a selection include a trench coat, jeans, a light knit, skirt and a great midi dress. Trainers and boots are master footwear choices, while a great bag will tie every look together and give you a polished edge. We’ve put together a sample capsule wardrobe of 11 transitional pieces to invest in now, making dressing between the season an effortless activity. Do you have a story to share?
