Our beloved Becks has tried his hand at baking, and now we can’t get the thought of honey cake out of our heads. On Sunday, David Beckham posted an Instagram story showing him measuring out delicious-looking honey before adding sugar and butter and attempting to whisk the mixture with only one hand. Despite the somewhat questionable method, Becks then showed us the finished product and we have to admit, we were suitably impressed. (And it certainly looked more appetising than some of Brooklyn’s cooking attempts.) Papa Becks’ video showed him drizzling icing over the cake and while it looked a little overbaked on the sides (which the footballer admitted to) he said his daughter Harper loved it. Who doesn’t love a fluffy sweet treat? Becks’ recipe was a little short on details, so for those drooling right now, we’ve got our hands on the ultimate honey cake recipe!
