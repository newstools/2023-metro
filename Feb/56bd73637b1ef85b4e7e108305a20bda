However, you may also be among the three quarters of women that get thrush in their lifetime, or the one in 20 who experience recurrent infections. Thrush, a yeast infection caused by the Candida species of fungus, can cause itching, burning, and pain during sex or urination. It can also be exacerbated by the wrong underwear. According to Canesten, ‘wearing very tight and synthetic underwear and clothes such as tight leggings can encourage the growth of candida because of the trapped moisture.’ Synthetic fabrics like nylon, polyester, rayon, spandex, mesh, lace, or satin are best avoided – which pretty much excludes you from the majority of lingerie deemed ‘sexy’. Thankfully, you don’t need to put the health of your microbiome at risk to get your partner’s heart racing this Valentine’s. Try these lingerie options that’ll have you feeling and looking your best, made with breathable fabrics to combat UTIs – and don’t forget to always pee after sex. Do you have a story to share?
