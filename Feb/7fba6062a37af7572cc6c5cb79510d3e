Dolly Parton has put to bed rumours of her endorsing any keto or CBD products in her usual sparkling fashion. The singer-songwriter, music icon, philanthropist, theme park owner and silent producer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer may have her fingers in many pies but she has reached out to correct impressions that she was lending her name to the promotion of any gummy product. The 77-year-old Tennessee-born country star’s account posted a statement to her social media on Wednesday correcting any notions among her fans and followers with a witty pushback. It read: ‘Dolly Parton is not affiliated with, has not endorsed and is not associated with any keto or CBD gummy product.’ ‘She’s more the cake, cookie and cornbread type,’ it concluded, to the amusement of her followers. Facebook adverts were reportedly circulating that allegedly suggested she was endorsing CBD gummies that claimed to ‘reverse dementia’ in fictional click-through articles. According to Snopes, readers had been inquiring about the adverts which used the 9 to 5 hitmaker’s name and image to make these claims, and led on seemingly unrelated post titles, including ‘Allegation(s) Against Dolly Parton Have Been Confirmed’. The fact-checking publication had classified these adverts’ accusations and endorsement claims as false, with scammers using her image and likeness without permission. With Dolly settling the matter once and for all, her loyal fans backed up their favourite with one posting: ‘Who is out here lying on Dolly’s name?!’ ‘I’ll get the pitchforks. You let me know where to meet you,’ joked another. Another follower commented: ‘Dolly is such a class act ❤️ (and also WHO had the nerve?! 😂).’ Dolly also wasn’t joking about being ‘the cake, cookie and cornbread type’, having posted just last week about her biscuit, brownie and cornbread mixes with Duncan Hines. The advert (clearly labelled, of course) showed her sharing the news personally in a video, decked out in a pink gingham shirt and pink and yellow butterfly apron. Got a story?
