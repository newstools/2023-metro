Pictures show a damaged home after a stolen VW Sharan was allegedly crashed into it following a brief police chase. A 14-year-old boy has been charged with aggravated vehicle taking, driving without a licence, and driving without insurance following the incident in Derby. The car is said to have been taken from a property on Stenson Road, before being spotted by a police officer on the road hours later. A ‘short pursuit’ lasted a matter of seconds before the vehicle collided with a house in Grampian Way in the early hours of this morning. The 14-year-old boy was arrested at the scene around 2.30am. He was taken to hospital but was not found to be seriously injured. People in the area have been warned not to go near the house, along with another property, due to potential danger. Experts have launched an assessment of the structural integrity of the pair. Grampian Way remains closed at the roundabout with Swallowdale Road. The suspect, who cannot be named, has been remanded in police custody. He will appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
