Meal deals could be banned by the Welsh government, leaving people ‘feeling lost’. The proposed legislation, which is aimed to tackle obesity, has been branded ‘the stupidest idea ever’ by those who love the sandwich, snack and drink combination. Conor McAdams, 22, told the BBC: ‘Without meal deals, I would be lost. ‘There are plenty of healthy options, it’s down to the individual if they get crisps or fruit. ‘A meal deal is convenient and cheap. It’s the stupidest idea I’ve heard.’ The Welsh Government insists they consulted with industry representatives however people argued the ban would leave them with no lunch to turn to. Rhys Stringer, 24, said: ‘I love a meal deal, and it’s healthier than a McDonalds or a KFC.’ Others say meal deals are a good way to buy a large lunch at a cheap price – which is particularly important amid the cost of living crisis. The restriction is being considered alongside bans on temporary price reductions and multi-buy offers. Asha Begum, 25, from Cardiff Bay, said: ‘I think meal deals are a good thing because it’s cheap – you can get three things for the price of one. ‘Money is a big thing.’ A Welsh government spokesperson said the proposals are designed to support better health. They added: ‘We have been discussing these with industry representatives and have consulted widely. We are considering the next steps on price promotions and locations. ‘The cost of living crisis will be given careful consideration in our decision making, alongside the significant impact obesity has on people’s health. ‘Any specific measures will be designed to promote healthier foods and reduce health inequalities and premature deaths.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
