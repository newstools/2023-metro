Manchester United midfielder Casemiro, Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and Manchester City duo Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland have all been named in the 2022 FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World XI. Lionel Messi, who was named men’s player of the year at the 2022 Best FIFA Awards at a ceremony in Paris on Monday evening, was also included but there was no place for Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time since 2007. Real Madrid trio Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Thibaut Courtois all made the cut following their success in the Champions League final and La Liga last season. Paris Saint-Germain duo Kylian Mbappe and Achraf Hakimi were also named in the XI. Speaking after picking up his trophy at the ceremony in Paris on Monday evening, Van Dijk said: ‘I feel blessed. It was an interesting year. I’m still very proud to be part of this football club.’ Meanwhile, De Bruyne has been named in the XI for a third year in a row and is joined by Haaland and Joao Cancelo, who left City to join Bayern Munich on loan last month. ‘Any time your fellow professionals vote to recognise your ability, it means so much,’ De Bruyne said. ‘To be in this World XI for the third year in a row really is fantastic and truly humbling. ‘I work hard every single day to ensure I am consistent; I want to perform at my highest level as often as possible. If other players recognise that it means I am doing something right. ‘I want to thank everyone who voted for me – but also the management, staff and players here at City because, without them, I could not do what I do.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
