A husband found his wife dying on the road and his step-daughter critically injured after they were hit by a car, a court has heard. Nicole Bowden, her daughter Emily Fox-Williams and her 11-month-old grandson had just left home and were walking to a pub when they were all struck by the convertible Mercedes. In a ‘cruel turn of fate’, Matthew Bowden was the first person on the tragic scene in Mosterton, Dorset, last Thursday evening. All three family members were airlifted to Bristol hospital, where Mrs Bowden, who was aged in her 40s, died from her injuries. Miss Fox-Williams, aged in her 20s, remains on life support and has so far been unresponsive. Her son is recovering from his injuries and is hoped will make a full recovery. The alleged driver, Shane Bovey, 40, was also taken to hospital before being arrested. He has since been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop after a road traffic collision, aggravated vehicle taking and making threats to kill. Bovey appeared at Poole Magistrates’ Court, but did not indicate a plea before his case was sent to crown court. He was refused bail and remanded in custody until the next hearing on March 16. Prosecutor Leah Dillon said: ‘By a very cruel turn of fate, the first people on the scene were her husband and step-son. ‘The victims were walking, perhaps even still in their driveway, to the pub. Nicole, her daughter and 11-month-old were all flown to hospital in Bristol. ‘Tragically Nicole did not make it. Her daughter Emily is on life support since the collision. ‘The 11-month-old baby is off sedation now and has injuries but will hopefully recover. ‘I’m not going to go into what the scene was like, but for her husband one can’t imagine how that was.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
