The president of Mexico claimed to have proof of a mythological woodland creature similar to an elf. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador posted a photo of what he said is an alux – a small Mayan spirit believed to be goblin-like critters who creates mischief. Mr Obrador shared the picture on Saturday and said it was ‘was taken three days ago by an engineer, it appears to be an alux’ adding ‘everything is mystical’. The night-time photo shows a tree with a branch forming what looks like a halo of hair and what may be stars forming the figure’s eyes. According to traditional Mayan belief, aluxes inhabit forests and fields and are prone to playing tricks on people, like hiding things. Some people leave small offerings to appease them. Several commented that the picture was not an alux, with one claiming the same photo did the rounds in Thailand in 2021. Others criticised the president for ‘not checking whether the photo was real before posting it’. Mr Obrador has never made any secret of his passion for traditional cultures and beliefs. When he was inaugurated in 2018, he took part in an indigenous purifying ceremony. He kneeled in a cloud of incense while healers performed a ritual with bunches of herbs. Mr Obrador also has engineers and workers constructing the Maya Train – a tourist project designed to go through the Yucatan Peninsula, known for its Mayan ruins. The ancient Mayan civilization reached its height between 300AD and 900AD on the Yucatan Peninsula and in adjacent parts of Central America, but the Mayas’ descendants continue to live on the peninsula. Many continue speaking the Mayan language and wearing traditional clothing, while also conserving traditional foods, crops, religion and medicine practices, despite the conquest of the region by the Spanish between 1527 and 1546.
