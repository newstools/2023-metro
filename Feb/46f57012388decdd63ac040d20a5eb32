Megan Fox had the best response to rumours of Machine Gun Kelly being unfaithful. The actress sparked speculation that she and the rapper had gone their separate ways on Sunday, when she deleted all traces of him from her Instagram feed, leaving just one photo remaining from 2021. Megan, 36, also unfollowed her husband-to-be â€“ real name Colson Baker â€“ but instead started following Harry Styles, Timothee Chalemet, and Eminem, who hasÂ had beef with MGKÂ in the past. Whatâ€™s more, she shared a series of stunning selfies, followed by a snap of a burning letter, with lyrics to BeyoncÃ©â€™s Pray You Can Catch Me, the opening track from her 2016 Lemonade album, which tells of husband Jay-Zâ€™s alleged infidelity. â€˜You can taste the dishonesty/ itâ€™s all over your breathâ€™, Megan wrote on Insta. While the Jenniferâ€™s Body star hasnâ€™t directly addressed the situation, that didnâ€™t stop her millions of followers from speculating, with some believing MGK, 32, cheated with their mutual friend. â€˜He probably got with Sophieâ€™, one person commented under Meganâ€™s recent post. Adding fuel to the fire, though, the Transformers star responded with a seriously sassy comeback. Megan â€“ who is openly bisexual â€“ replied: â€˜maybe I got with Sophie ðŸ”¥â€™. Itâ€™s safe to say fans were living for the subtle burn, with one commenting back: â€˜our bi queen ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’•â€™ Another wrote: â€˜ya donâ€™t clapÂ @meganfoxÂ she. Will. Clap. Back.â€™ Megan has since deleted her Instagram account completely, with her profile not appearing when searched for. The movie star and MGK got tother after meeting in 2020, on set for movie Midnight In The Switchgrass. They were spotted spending time together in May that year after Meganâ€™s ex-husband Brian Austin GreenÂ confirmed they had splitÂ after 10 years of marriage. They then got engaged in 2022, afterÂ MGK popped the questionÂ and Megan showed off her eye-popping ring on social media, writing in part: â€˜Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him.â€™ Fans were left slightly uncomfortable, though, as the musician confirmed the band he designed included two thorns, which would hurt if the ring were removed.
