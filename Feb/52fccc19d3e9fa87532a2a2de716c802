Kim Jong-un has not been seen in public for 35 days – sparking rumours about his health. The North Korean dictator had been expected to attend a military parade this week. Satellite images gave an insight into early rehearsals which began in December.

The dictator has skipped a meeting on an agriculture crisis, NK News reported, and has seemingly stepped back from the spotlight in recent weeks. But it is not the first time he has done so. The leader’s 35 day break also matches another prolonged absence at the end of 2021, NK News reported. Preparations for the celebration of the foundation of the Korean People’s Army have been under way since December. Citizens have assembled have been seen wearing medical masks alongside multiple mysterious structures covered in black drapes. Pyongyang was recently locked down following the rapid spread of an ‘unspecified’ respiratory illness. An enforcement notice released by Kim’s Government made no mention of Covid-19. However, it did cite an ‘increase in winter cases of recurrent flu and other respiratory diseases’. In the lead-up to February 8, videos have also emerged of military aircraft flying in formation over central Pyongyang towards Kim Il-sung square, where most major events are held. The grand celebration comes as the country suffers from severe food shortages.
