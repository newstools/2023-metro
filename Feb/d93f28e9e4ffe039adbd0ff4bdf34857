A man has been jailed after he pulled his trousers down and pressed his genitals against a mum while she was on the Tube with her daughter. Hasan Degirmenci, 34, was on a Piccadilly line train on December 2 last year when he committed the sexual assault. The woman and her 12-year-old daughter were about to reach their stop when she felt something pressed up against her from behind. Her daughter then saw Degirmenci pushing his groin on her mum with his trousers down and genitals exposed. The woman confronted Degirmenci and followed him off the train to Knightsbridge station where she told staff what had happened. They called the British Transport Police and Degirmenci was arrested and remanded in custody. He pleaded guilty to sexual assault and one count of indecent exposure at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court in December. Now, Inner London Crown Court has handed him a 16-month jail sentence and a five-year sexual harm prevention order. He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. Detective constable Kathryn Faine said: ‘This incident was extremely alarming and distressing both for the woman and her young daughter. ‘He targeted the victim in a crowded environment for his own sexual gratification, and I hope his jail term sends a clear message to anyone who exhibits this type of behaviour on the network – it simply won’t be tolerated.’ Transport for London’s head of policing and community safety, Mandy McGregor, said: ‘This was an appalling incident. ‘No one should ever experience sexual harassment on our network and we are working closely with the British Transport Police to make the transport network a hostile place for offenders.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
