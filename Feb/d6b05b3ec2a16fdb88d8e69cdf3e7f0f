A man wearing a motorcycle helmet was seen brandishing a machete during a terrifying street brawl. Footage shows at least nine people coming to blows in the Kingstanding area of Birmingham on Wednesday afternoon. The machete-wielding moped rider can be seen waving the huge blade around in the air, kicking mopeds to the ground and handing a different knife to someone else. A scuffle broke out on the opposite side of the road before several of the men fled on mopeds, including one with Deliveroo branding on the back. The man with the machete ran off, eventually jumping onto a white moped without a number plate. Police said they were called to ‘reports of a disorder where weapons were brandished’. No arrests have been made but investigations are still ongoing. The main suspect was wearing gloves and a balaclava under his helmet so it will no doubt be difficult to identify him. Witnesses said they were ‘appalled’ by the violence in broad daylight. The chaos broke out at around 4pm – a time when children could have been walking home from school. Many locals asked where the police were at the time with one saying he does not feel ‘safe to leave the house’ as the fight happened ‘down the road from him’. Another speculated that the brawl was between people trying to steal mopeds and delivery drivers going after them. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
