Forget February 14, it’s February 15 that we are all looking forward to. Why? This Wednesday is when the McSpicy burger returns to McDonald’s for good. The burger consists of a delicious spicy chicken breast fillet topped with lettuce and classic sandwich sauce between toasted sesame seed buns. Yes, we’re drooling too. The fast food chain launched the McSpicy – their hottest ever burger – in July 2021, before taking it off the menu just six weeks later. It was a limited edition item – but clearly made an impression, as it’s now making a permanent return. So, if you’ve missed the spicy heat, you have less than a week to wait before you’ll be able to indulge in the burger once again. The McSpicy will be on sale in stores for £4.79 – which is cheaper than the £5.49 price it cost when it initially launched. If you’re opting for an extra-value meal with the McSpicy it’ll set you back £6.29. Gráinne Allen, the director of food and innovation at McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said: ‘We’re so pleased to be welcoming the McSpicy to our permanent menu across the UK and Ireland. ‘The McSpicy brings the heat to our menu, and we hope chicken lovers across the nation are as excited about its permanence as we are.’ Do you have a story to share?
