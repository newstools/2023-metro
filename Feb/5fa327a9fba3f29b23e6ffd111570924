The new deputy chairman of the Conservative Party said he would support the return of the death penalty. ‘Nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed,’ Lee Anderson bluntly said. ‘You know that, don’t you? 100% success rate.’ The outspoken Ashfield MP was given the important Government position during Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday. His comments about capital punishment were made in an interview with The Spectator magazine a few days before his appointment. The UK outlawed the death penalty for murder in 1969 and then totally abolished it for all crimes in 1998. The country later adopted the 13th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which prohibits the restoration of the death penalty. But Mr Anderson argued heinous crimes where the perpetrators are clearly identifiable should be punished by execution. He used the example of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013 by Islamist extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years for running over and stabbing the British Army soldier in Woolwich, south-east London. Mr Anderson said: ‘You’ll get the certain groups saying: “You can never prove it.” ‘Well, you can prove it if they have videoed it and are on camera – like the Lee Rigby killers. ‘I mean: they should have gone, same week. I don’t want to pay for these people.’ Mr Anderson also suggested using Royal Navy ships to return people arriving in small boats to France. He said he would ‘send migrant boats straight back the same day’. ‘I’d put them on a Royal Navy frigate or whatever and sail it to Calais, have a stand-off and they’d just stop coming,’ he added.
