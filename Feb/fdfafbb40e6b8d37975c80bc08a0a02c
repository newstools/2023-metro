Paris Saint-Germain defender Achraf Hakimi is being investigated by French authorities after being accused of sexual assault. A 24-year-old woman has accused the Morocco international of raping her at his home in the Boulogne-Billancourt area of Paris on February 25. The woman went to a police station in the Nogent-sur-Marne district of Paris on Sunday to report the incident but did not file charges. However, French newspaper Le Parisien reports that French prosecutors opened an investigation on Monday. It’s claimed that Hakimi and the woman had messaged on Instagram before they met at his home. The public prosecutor’s office handling the case in Nanterre complained to AFP that ‘information already made public’ in the media ‘undermined the necessary investigations to find out the truth’. Hakimi is married to Spanish actress Hiba Abouk and the couple have two sons. It’s understood that Abouk and their two children were on holiday in Dubai at the time the alleged incident took place. Hakimi has missed PSG’s last two Ligue 1 due to a hamstring injury. The 24-year-old also played for Morocco at the World Cup in December. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
