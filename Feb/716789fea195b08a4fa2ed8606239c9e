Manchester United outcast Mason Greenwood will remain sidelined for at least the remainder of the season as the club conduct an internal investigation into the striker’s behaviour. The England international was suspended by the club in January 2022 after being charged with attempted rape, assault and coercive behaviour. Those charges were dropped earlier this month, meaning Greenwood has not been found guilty of any crime. However, the club want to conduct their own internal inquiry into videos that were posted by Greenwood’s then-girlfriend 13 months ago. Though Greenwood is keen to put the matter behind him, United’s inquiry is set to take several months. The Daily Mail say that will rule him out of returning to action this season and Greenwood will not be considered for the remainder of the campaign. Greenwood’s future will depend on the outcome of the investigation but he has two years to run on his deal, with the option of extending that by a further 12 months until 2026. United could opt to keep Greenwood and reintegrate him into the first team, though that option would mean waiting until the start of next season. If United see no future for Greenwood, they could look to sell him in the summer transfer market. The third, and most drastic, option is terminating Greenwood’s contract. Greenwood has spoken to Erik ten Hag following the dropped charges and he’s likely to be interviewed by the club as part of the investigation.
