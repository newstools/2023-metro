The Glazer family is ‘split’ on whether or not to accept an offer lower than £5 billion to sell Manchester United, according to reports. The United owners put the club on the market in November, with the family open to anything from investment to a full sale of the club. The Americans have set a soft deadline of next Friday for potential buyers or investors to register their interest with a group of Qataris set to make a bid. It had been previously thought that the Glazers would not sell for lower than £6 billion – but The Times are now reporting that the family are divided on what to do with an offer below £5 billion. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man, has publicly declared his interest in buying the club and is the fans’ favourite to take charge having grown up as a United supporter. There are expected to be two further ‘serious’ bids for the club – one from Saudi Arabia and another from America. Any full sale of the club is expected to be a record for a sports franchise and will dwarf the £2.5bn paid for Chelsea last year as Todd Boehly took over from Roman Abramovich. United require at least £1bn to renovate Old Trafford or £2bn to build a completely new stadium, while the training ground needs around £100m in investment. Most United fans have been deeply unhappy with the Glazer family’s ownership after they assumed control in 2005 and saddled the club with debt. Supporters regularly wear yellow and green scarves at Old Trafford – a symbol of protest against the Glazers.
