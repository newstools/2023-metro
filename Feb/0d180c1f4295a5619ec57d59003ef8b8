The ‘no pants trend’ is what it’s being referred to en masse, likely thanks to the fact that it’s American it-girls like Bella Hadid, Tessa Thompson and Kendall Jenner who are spearheading the trend. Think ‘pants’ as in the American word for trousers… not your knickers. Maybe it’s a natural progression from popular, leggy moments like that Miu Miu micro skirt. Maybe it’s an offshoot of the current trend we’re seeing for nearly-naked glamour. Or maybe Bella Hadid wearing boxers, a Lego t-shirt and socks with Uggs is more to do with, as trend forecaster Agustina Panzoni predicted in one of her many fascinating TikTok videos, the rise of ‘meta cringe’. Regardless of why this trend has reared its head, we’ve been noticing a marked decrease in the number of trousers and skirts gracing the limbs of models and fashionistas all winter. Meanwhile, at the latest Fashion Weeks around the world, we’ve seen variations of trouser-free looks both on the street and the catwalks. Yes, it looks chilly, but it’s oh-so-chic. Tights, socks and boots might cover the legs, but the lack of trousers and traditional skirts has been spotted everywhere on the fashion scene this winter.Want to recreate the look?
