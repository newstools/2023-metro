Fury won the eight-round contest with a split decision victory as two judges scored it 76-73 in his favour, while the other judge scored the bout 75-74 for Paul. Meanwhile, BT Sport were forced to issue an on-air apology moments before the fourth round following a mid-fight interview with Logan Paul, Jake’s older brother. After giving his verdict on how he thought the fight was going, Logan Paul then turned on Tommy Fury and his family. ‘Tommy Fury if you can hear me, you a bitch bro, you’re gassing out, the whole Fury a family of bitches,’ Logan Paul said. The interview was broadcast around the arena and was met with boos by the crowd. Tyson Fury, who is the half-brother of Tommy, was sitting ringside. Meanwhile, Tommy’s father John was in his corner preparing him for the fourth round. BT Sport commentator Darren Fletcher said after Logan Paul’s interview: ‘Well I have to say that’s the last thing we need between rounds. ‘The fight needs to stand on its own, we don’t need nonsense like that.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
