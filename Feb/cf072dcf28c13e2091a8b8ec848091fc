This is the moment when cabin crew try in vain to break up a mass brawl over a window seat on a plane in Brazil. The row erupted between two families on a Gol Airlines flight bound from Salvador to Sao Paulo-Congonhas on February 2. The drama reportedly began when a mother asked another passenger if she could swap seats with her child, who has special needs. When she was turned down, reported local media, she saw red and immediately launched into the woman. The fight quickly escalated and footage from the cabin shows how luckless aircrew tried in vain to break up the scrap. Phone footage filmed by passengers shows one woman holding onto the back of the seat as her crop top is pulled down, leaving her topless in the aisle. After the tussle finally died down, 15 brawlers were kicked off the flight. Gol Airlines later said in a statement: ‘The scene in the video doing the rounds on social networks took place before flight G3 1659 took off this Thursday (02/02) from Salvador (SSA) to Congonhas (CGH), in Sao Paulo. ‘The people involved in the scenes of aggression were disembarked and did not continue their journey. ‘The company condemns all acts of violence and stresses that the actions taken by the crew were taken with regards to safety, Gol’s number-one priority.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
