Manchester United look set to be without Anthony Martial, Marcel Sabitzer, Antony and Scott McTominay ahead of Thursday’s Europa League play-off first leg clash against Barcelona. The quartet were missing from training on Wednesday as the Red Devils trained in Manchester before departing for Spain this afternoon. United take on Barcelona in a two-legged Europa League play-off, with the winner progressing to the knockout stages. Erik ten Hag’s side beat Leeds United on Sunday without Antony, Martial and McTominay. The Dutchman said before the clash that he didn’t expect the trio to return for the game against Barcelona but he didn’t rule anything out. Martial has had an injury-plagued season and is struggling with a hip injury, while Anthony has missed the last two games with a leg issue. McTomiany’s issue is unspecified but his absence is longer term than Martial and Antony. Sabitzer, a loan signing from Bayern Munich on deadline day, is suspended for Thursday’s game but was not present at training in any case. Casemiro did train with the team as he looks to return from missing the last two matches through suspension. Lisandro Martinez, who is also suspended for the trip to the Camp Nou, also trained.
