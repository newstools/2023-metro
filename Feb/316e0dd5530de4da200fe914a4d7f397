Oleksandr Zinchenko has revealed the ‘unbelievable lesson’ Arsenal learned in their 4-2 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. Villa took a surprise 1-0 lead before Buyako Saka levelled it up but the Gunners went in at half-time 2-1 down thanks to a strike from Philippe Coutinho. The north London club needed a huge second-half performance to turn it around and Zinchenko bagged his first-ever Premier League goal to make it 2-2 just after the hour mark. Arsenal then scored twice in added time, with an owl goal from Emiliano Martinez  and a 98th-minute goal from substitute Gabriel Martinelli securing all three points in dramatic fashion. Speaking after what was a massive victory for Mikel Arteta’s team in the title race, Ukraine international Zinchenko told BT Sport: ‘From this game I would like to say two things. ‘First we took an unbelievable lesson for all of us that we need to believe until the very end. ‘Like I said in the past, this group has such amazing people, can achieve everything they want. ‘If we are going to keep fighting and keep believing. The reaction from all of us in the second half is a perfect way to go. ‘There are still a lot of games to play and we just need to keep going, keep fighting and keep believing we can do everything. ‘I’m so happy to help with my goal but most important is to take the three points.’ Jorginho, who moved to the Emirates in the January transfer window from Chelsea, added: ‘That’s the Premier League. ‘That’s why it’s the best league in the world. It’s just beautiful. It was very important after the last results we had. ‘The start wasn’t easy when we were not producing our game. We came in at half-time, had a chat and then we went back doing the basics we need to do and changed the game.’ MORE : Paul Merson feared Arsenal were set to finish third in Premier League before dramatic win over Aston Villa MORE : Mikel Arteta explains decision to bench Gabriel Martinelli for Arsenal's clash with Villa
