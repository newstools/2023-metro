Johnny Knoxville may have accidentally given too much away, and has hinted where the next The White Lotus will be held. Fans have been desperately awaiting the news of the location, after season one was filmed at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, while season two took us to Sicily, and was filmed at the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in the town of Taormina. After two stunning locations, The White Lotus fans are desperate to know where season three could be – and it seems Johnny has spilt the tea. The Jackass star is a very close friend to creator Mike White, and accidentally began: ‘He and I had been in  Tokyo together.’ He continued to Vulture: ‘I think that’s where the next… oh, I’m not giving anything away. ‘I might call him again as soon as this is over.’ Mike has previously teased that the next filming location would be set somewhere in the East. He addressed speculation towards the end of last year, saying: ‘The first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex.’ Mike continued to Variety: ‘I think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. ‘It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.’ Mike had previously told Deadline: ‘I think it’d be fun to maybe go to a whole different continent. You know, we did Europe, and maybe Asia, something crazy like that, that would be fun.’ The White Lotus is available to stream on NOW. Got a story?
