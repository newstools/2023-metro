A collection of Cambodian Crown Jewels – dating as far back as the 7th century – have been returned to the nation after being found in London. Experts were left stunned after finding dozens of artefacts, most of which have never been seen before. The items belonged to the late British art dealer, and antiquities smuggler, Douglas Latchford, who died in 2020 while awaiting trial in the US for art trafficking. His family agreed to return the collection to the nation in south east Asia, but it wasn’t clear what items would be included. The collection of 77 items is full of ‘gold and other precious metal pieces from the pre-Angkorian and Angkorian period’. These include ‘necklaces, bracelets, belts, earrings and amulets,’ according to the Cambodian ministry. The Angkorian period began in AD 802, when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself a ‘universal monarch’ and ‘god-king,’ and lasted until the late 14th century. Another item, a large bowl, is thought to date back to the 11th century and is thought to be made of solid gold. Experts believe this may have been used as a rice bowl for Angkorian royalty. Head of Cambodia’s investigative team, Brad Gordon, was the first representative to see the jewellery in a visit to London last summer. He told the BBC: ‘I was driven by a representative of the Latchford family to an undisclosed location. ’In the parking lot was a vehicle with four boxes inside. ‘I felt like crying. I just thought – wow – the crown jewels of ancient Cambodian civilization packed into four boxes in the back of a car.’ The items are set to go on display in the country’s national museum after being returned to Cambodia They are currently in the capital, Phnom Penh after being delivered on Friday, February 17th. It comes after Cambodia previously received five lost stone and bronze artefacts from the family back in 2021. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
