The owners of the field where Prince Harry lost his virginity have said they ‘could put up a blue plaque’ to celebrate the occasion. Anna Pitt-Stanley and Dean Ellwood live in Splash Cottage, next to the site where the then 17-year-old royal had sex for the first time with Sasha Walpole, who was aged 19. Harry revealed he lost his virginity to an older woman in a field in Norton, Wiltshire, in his bombshell memoir Spare. Dean told the Sun Online: ‘I suppose I could put up a blue plaque in the field, but I don’t think many people would be interested.’ Anna added: ‘Everyone in the village is talking about it but I don’t think we will be setting up a gift shop selling memorabilia.’ At the time of the Prince’s frolic in 2001, the field belonged to The Vine Tree Inn. In his memoir, Harry wrote he had a ‘humiliating episode with an older woman who liked macho horses and who treated me like a young stallion’. He ‘mounted her quickly, after which she spanked my ass and sent me away’. However, Harry failed to warn Sasha he was publishing the intimate details of their triste. In an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV, Sasha said: ‘He could have given me a heads up of “I’m gonna put it in the book”. ‘People are asking family and friends, “Oh yeah, we know who it is” and then suddenly it’s just the reality of this isn’t going to go away. ‘Forever this is going to flare up until they know who it is, they’re going to be questioning people and yes I could not have said anything but then it’s never going to stop… this is a means to an end.’ According to Sasha, their encounter only lasted about five minutes, and they never spoke again afterwards.
