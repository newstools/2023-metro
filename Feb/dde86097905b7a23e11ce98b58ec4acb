A Sphynx cat cruelly tattooed by a criminal gang behind bars in Mexico has been rescued and needs a new home. The feline, which doesn’t have a name, and is about one year old, was found in a jail where it suffered mistreatment by criminals. The crooks even tattooed ‘Made in Mexico’ into its furless skin, with other markings on both sides of its body. She was taken into care by animal rescue workers in the Mexican city of Juarez after police discovered her. Authorities say they are now looking for the right family to take the cat, which is not for sale, into their home. ‘The cat is very sociable, and is in great shape, with no infections,’ Cesar Rene Diaz, ecology director for the city of Juarez, told Reuters. A committee of city authorities will make the final decision about the adoption before presenting the cat to its new family in a ceremony on March 1. Sphynx cats are known for their lack of a fur coat and loose skin that forms wrinkles in some areas. Due to the lack of fur, the Sphynx cat bone structure and musculature are on display.
