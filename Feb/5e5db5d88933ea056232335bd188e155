Air fryers have become a kitchen staple for many. The kitchen appliance is all anyone has been talking about the past year or so – with new quick and simple air fryer recipes being released every day. But, despite the popularity, many are still getting to grips with the device and all the things you can make with it. The latest revelation is that the humble egg can be cooked in it. It can take years to master the ‘perfect’ boiled egg on the hob, but the lifestyle experts at Cath Kidston have stressed you can use your air fryer to take the stress out of cooking one. They said: ‘Forget about grabbing pots and pans and waiting an age for the water to boil, that’s old school. ‘Instead, to make the perfect boiled eggs, all you need to do is pop them in the air fryer at 150°C and go about your day while they cook.’ The experts suggest cooking them for eight minutes for soft-boiled eggs (AKA, with a lovely runny yolk for dipping), ten minutes for medium-boiled or 12 for hard-boiled. You also just need to pop the eggs in the air fryer basket without any water. It really is as simple as that.
