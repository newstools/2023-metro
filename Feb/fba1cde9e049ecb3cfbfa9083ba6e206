Bruno Fernandes admits he was at fault for Leeds United’s opening goal in Manchester United’s 2-2 draw on Wednesday evening. Erik ten Hag’s side battled back from two goals down to rescue a point at Old Trafford as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho scored in the second half. Wilfried Gnonto got Leeds off to a flying start with a superb strike in the first minute of the game but in the build up to the goal, Fernandes lost possession which allowed the visitors to attack quickly. And the Portugal international concedes he should have been ‘stronger’ on the ball in order to prevent Leeds’ opener. ‘We’re not happy, obviously, with the result,’ Fernandes told Premier League Productions. ‘Our main goal today was to win the game. We didn’t, we get one point, it’s really frustrating because we started the first half and second half really badly, conceding goals in the first few minutes. ‘The team had a great reaction, it was a massive reaction and great to see it, but it wasn’t the result we wanted. ‘It was nothing to do with [team] changes, it doesn’t mean anything, in the first few minutes of the game we conceded a goal, I should’ve been stronger in the second duel, I won the first but in the second I should’ve been stronger, they got the ball then they scored a goal. ‘After I think we had control of the game, they did nothing, I think we did pretty well, created a lot of chances but not good enough to score the chances. ‘We have to look forward now to the next game, it’s coming quick, it’s them again, away, it will be a big game again but hopefully a different result for us.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
