Kate Middleton has once again solidified her fashion credentials by stepping out in a gorgeous hound’s tooth-print skirt today in Wales. The skirt was previously on sale for just £20 in Zara, but is sadly no longer available online. The Princess of Wales teamed the skirt with a cream roll neck and matching cream Alexander McQueen coat, during two appearances at Aberavon Leisure and Fitness Centre in Port Talbot and Brynawel Rehabilitation Centre near the town of Pontyclun, Mid Glamorgan. Kate, who appeared alongside her husband Prince William, teamed the outfit with a Mulberry bag and knee-high boots. We’ve been lusting after the royal’s wardrobe on multiple occasions already in 2023, whether she’s wearing her trusty Veja trainers for an off-duty look, staying classic with her staple camel coat, or pairing a red carpet gown with £18 Zara earrings. The latter ended up on eBay for £110, and we’re sure it won’t be long before fans are copying her latest look, too.
