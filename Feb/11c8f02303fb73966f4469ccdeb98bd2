Is there anything worse than hard butter scuffing up your perfect toast? Whether you let a chunk sit on the warm toast for a bit, or try to heat up the dairy product beforehand, it can feel like a battle just to achieve a simple buttered slice. But athlete Jessica Fox on TikTok has a different technique. The champion slalom canoeist recently revealed her own butter hack that’s very similar to using a glue stick. Jessica explains that she butters her toast straight from the block – just how you would stick something down with glue. In the video, shared to her account @jessfoxcanoe, the Olympian can be seen using her preferred method. She says: ‘So this is how I butter my toast. It might be a little bit controversial. Does it make you feel uncomfortable or am I a genius?’ ‘It’s just easier, no clumps of butter or holes in the bread. surely I’m not the only one?’ It’s safe to say that Jessica’s hack has caused some controversy – with many saying this method ‘bothered’ them deeply. But others have praised the creative trick. One person said: ‘That’s not a bad idea. I now need butter and toast butter so I don’t transfer any crumbs on to other things that’s not toast.’ Another added: ‘It gets the job done, and saves on washing a knife. Genius.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
