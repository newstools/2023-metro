The murder of trans girl Brianna Ghey is now being probed as a possible hate crime. The teenager, from Birchwood in Warrington, Cheshire, was found by members of the public on a path in Linear Park, Culcheth, at around 3.13pm on Saturday. Cheshire Police previously said there was no evidence to suggest the 16-year-old was the victim of a hate crime. But today, the force issued a statement which said all lines of inquiry were being explored, ‘including whether this was a hate crime’. Police pleaded with people to ‘avoid speculation’ on social media and be wary of spreading misinformation relating to the case. It comes as friends of Brianna revealed she had been bullied for years at school because of her gender identity. A number of LGBTQ+ activists and MPS have also highlighted online the dangers that trans people face in the country. A boy and girl, both aged 15, have been arrested on suspicion of the schoolgirl’s murder. Police have since been granted a 30-hour extension to question both of them. Got a story?
