Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag wants to sign a centre forward and a central midfielder this summer to take the next steps of his rebuild at Old Trafford. The Dutchman ended United’s six-year trophy drought on Sunday with a 2-0 win against Newcastle United at Wembley in the Carabao Cup final. Ten Hag oversaw £220m worth of spending last summer, which was roughly £90m more than the club had budgeted for. However, all of Ten Hag’s signings – Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Lisandro Martinez – have proven successful so far. Optimism among supporters has never been so high in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era but Ten Hag is acutely aware that his side needs strengthening in the summer. According to the Manchester Evening News, Ten Hag wants to sign a central striker and a central midfielder. Frenkie de Jong was a priority target last summer and United only ended their pursuit of the Dutchman two weeks before the window closed in order to sign Casemiro. Ten Hag feels the Barcelona star is still perfect for his side and will once again move for the former Ajax ace. But even if De Jong remains keen to stay at Barcelona, Ten Hag plans on signing another midfielder with Jude Bellingham also on his shortlist. Of more importance is a centre forward. Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen are both of interest, though there’s some deliberation within the club as to who should be targeted. United will offload Anthony Martial and Alex Telles to raise funds, while they’ll listen to bids for Donny van de Beek, Harry Maguire and Anthony Elanga.
