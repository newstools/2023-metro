A chubby street cat has become the top-rated tourist attraction in a Polish city. The black and white moggie – who is said to be a tad cantankerous – has stolen the hearts of tourists visiting Szczecin, northwest Poland. Also known as the ‘King of Kaszubska Street’, Gacek lives in a wooden box and is fed by passers-by in the medieval city. His name translates as ‘long-eared bat’ in Polish. Though a ‘fantastically handsome and superb fellow’, Gacek is known to scratch or steal food when in a bad mood, according to locals. Szczecin, close to the border with Germany, offers visitors a wealth of fascinating tourist attractions, including the Pomeranian Duke’s Castle and Kasprowicza Park. But they pale in comparison to the grumpy moggie, who has earnt a near-perfect 5-star rating on Google Maps. Gacek – who even has his own Instagram page – first arrived on Kaszubska Street 10 years ago and has slowly risen to stardom. He started out hanging around with tourists who fed him treats, causing Gacek to pile on the pounds. However, the chunky cat did not rise to fame until 2020, after the local news site wSzczecinie posted videos of him. Some have raised concerns for his welfare and criticise those who excessively feed him, though people in the local area do watch out for him. Outside Gacek’s house, a sign asks passers-by to refrain from disturbing him when he is asleep, though they can leave him a treat or two if he is out and about. For now, the ‘King of Kaszubska Street’ seems content living in his wooden box, outside a shop. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
